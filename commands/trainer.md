**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Invoke the `aops-trainer` skill IMMEDIATELY. The skill provides all context, workflows, and documentation needed for agent optimization tasks.

**DO NOT**:
- Attempt to figure out instructions on your own
- Search for documentation manually
- Start work before loading the skill

The aops-trainer skill contains:
- Complete workflow guidance
- Documentation references
- Anti-bloat enforcement protocols
- Experiment-driven methodology

After the skill loads, follow its instructions precisely.
