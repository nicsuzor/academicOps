# /do - Execute Work

**Command Redirect**: This command invokes the **Orchestration Loop ("The Hypervisor")** defined in [[WORKFLOWS.md]].

## Usage

When you receive a complex request or explicitly invoke `/do`, you MUST:

1. **Read [[WORKFLOWS.md]]**.
2. **Adopt the "Universal Mandates"**.
3. **Execute the "Orchestration Loop"**:
   - Phase 0: Context & Classification
   - Phase 1: Planning (with Critic Review)
   - Phase 2: Execution (Delegation)
   - Phase 3: Verification (QA)
   - Phase 4: Conclusion (Reflect/Persist)

## Workflow Selection

Consult [[WORKFLOWS.md#workflow-tracks]] to select the specific track:

- **TDD** (Features/Code)
- **Debug** (Fixes)
- **Batch** (Multi-file)
- **Framework** (Architecture)

**DO NOT** improvise a workflow. Follow the strict gates defined in the Catalog.
