# Skills Index

Quick reference for routing user requests to skills/commands. When a request matches triggers below, use `[[direct-skill]]` workflow and invoke directly.

## Commands (User-Invocable)

| Command | Triggers | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/aops` | "show capabilities", "what can you do", "help with framework" | Show framework capabilities - commands, skills, agents, and how to use them |
| `/diag` | "what's loaded", "session status", "diagnostic" | Quick diagnostic check of what's currently loaded in this session |
| `/dump` | "emergency handoff", "save work", "interrupted" | Emergency work handover - update bead, file follow-ups, persist to memory, output reflection, halt |
| `/email` | "process email", "email to task", "handle this email" | Create "ready for action" bd issues from emails - with summaries, downloaded documents, and clear response requirements |
| `/learn` | "framework issue", "fix this pattern", "improve the system" | Make minimal, graduated framework tweaks with experiment tracking |
| `/log` | "log observation", "note this", "framework feedback" | Log framework observations to bd issues for continuous improvement |
| `/pull` | "pull task", "get work", "what should I work on", "next task" | Pull a task from the queue, execute it with hydrator guidance, and complete with session reflection |
| `/q` | "queue this", "add to queue", "do this later", "file task" | Queue a task for later execution by creating bd issue(s) - expands prompt to identify discrete tasks |

## Skills (Auto-Triggered)

These skills activate based on task context, not explicit invocation:

| Skill | Triggers | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `/analyst` | — | Support academic research data analysis using dbt and Streamlit. Use this skill when working with computational research projects (identified by dbt/ directory, Streamlit apps, or empirical data pipelines). The skill enforces academicOps best practices for reproducible, transparent, self-documenting research with collaborative single-step workflow. |
| `/audit` | "framework audit", "check structure" | Comprehensive framework governance audit - structure checking, justification checking, and index file updates. |
| `/convert-to-md` | "convert document", DOCX/PDF/XLSX conversion | Batch convert documents (DOCX, PDF, XLSX, TXT, PPTX, MSG, DOC) to markdown, preserving tracked changes and comments. |
| `/daily` | "daily list", "daily note", "morning briefing", "update daily", "daily update" | Daily note lifecycle - morning briefing, task recommendations, session sync. SSoT for daily note structure. |
| `/dashboard` | "show dashboard", "task visibility" | Cognitive Load Dashboard - Live Streamlit dashboard for task visibility and session activity monitoring. |
| `/excalidraw` | "draw diagram", "mind map", "visual diagram" | Creating visually compelling, hand-drawn diagrams with organic mind-map layouts and accessibility-focused design. |
| `/flowchart` | "create flowchart", "mermaid diagram", process flow | Creating clear, readable, and attractive Mermaid flowcharts with best practices for accessibility, layout, and maintainability. |
| `/framework` | framework development, hooks, agents | academicOps related framework skills |
| `/garden` | "prune knowledge", "consolidate notes", PKM maintenance | Incremental PKM maintenance - weeding, pruning, linking, consolidating. Tends the knowledge base bit by bit. |
| `/pdf` | "convert to PDF", "make PDF", markdown to PDF | Convert markdown documents to professionally formatted PDFs with academic-style typography, Roboto fonts, proper page layouts, and styling suitable for research documents, reviews, reports, and academic writing. |
| `/python-dev` | Python code, .py files, type safety | Write production-quality Python code following fail-fast philosophy, type safety, and modern best practices. Enforces rigorous standards for academic and research code where correctness and replicability are paramount. |
| `/remember` | "remember this", "save to memory", "store knowledge" | Write knowledge to markdown AND sync to memory server. MUST invoke - do not write markdown directly. |
| `/session-insights` | "session summary", "generate insights" | Generate comprehensive session insights from transcripts using Gemini |
| `/task-viz` | — | Generate visual mind-map of bd issues using force-directed layout via excalidraw |

## Routing Rules

1. **Explicit match**: User says "/daily" or "update my daily" → invoke `/daily` directly
2. **Trigger match**: User request matches trigger phrases → suggest skill, confirm if ambiguous
3. **Context match**: File types or project structure indicate skill → apply skill guidance
4. **No match**: Route through normal workflow selection (WORKFLOWS.md)

## Why This Index Exists

Hydrator uses this to immediately recognize skill invocations without memory search, reducing latency for known workflows.
