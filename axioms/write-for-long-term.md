# Write For The Long Term

**Statement**: NEVER create single-use scripts or tests. Build infrastructure that guarantees replicability.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via AXIOMS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
