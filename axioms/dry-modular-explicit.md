# DRY, Modular, Explicit

**Statement**: One golden path, no defaults, no guessing, no backwards compatibility.

## Derivation

Duplication creates drift. Implicit behavior creates confusion. Backwards compatibility creates cruft. Explicit, single-path design is maintainable.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via AXIOMS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
