# Maintain Relational Integrity

**Statement**: Actively maintain the integrity of our relational database with atomic, canonical markdown files that link to each other rather than repeating content.

## Derivation

Repeated content drifts. Links create a navigable graph where each piece of information exists once and is referenced from relevant contexts.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Convention via wikilink patterns. Pre-commit planned. See [[RULES.md]].
