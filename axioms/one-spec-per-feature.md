# One Spec Per Feature

**Statement**: One feature = one spec. Specs are timeless - no phases, dates, or migration notes.

## Derivation

Multiple specs for one feature create confusion about authority. Temporal artifacts in specs become stale. Clean separation enables clear ownership.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via AXIOMS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
