# AcademicOps: Rigorous Academic Writing with AI Assistance

> A comprehensive framework for producing world-class academic research articles with LLM assistance while maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity.

## 🎯 Project Goals

AcademicOps establishes a new paradigm for academic writing that leverages the power of AI language models while ensuring:

- **Absolute academic integrity** through multi-layered verification systems
- **Preservation of authorial voice** with the researcher maintaining full control
- **Efficient workflow** using modern development practices
- **Transparent collaboration** via version control and issue tracking
- **Scalable architecture** for managing multiple research projects

## 🏗️ Core Principles

- The human author maintains **complete responsibility** for the final text
- Citation of AI-generated ideas follows the same rigor as human sources
- Maintain a clear **audit trail** of AI interactions
- **Scholarly sources** always take precedence over AI suggestions
- Every factual claim requires **independent verification**
- AI interpretations must be **cross-checked** against original texts

## AI workflow requirements:
- Work in **small, manageable chunks** (max 1000 words)
- Each chunk undergoes **multiple review cycles**
- Continuous improvement through **version control**
- Every factual claim must have a primary source
- AI-suggested references must be independently verified
- Disputed claims must be resolved before proceeding

### Best Practices Integration
- Git-based version control for all content
- Issue tracking for tasks and revisions
- Automated quality checks
- Full tracing and logging for AI generations
- Continuous integration for document assembly
