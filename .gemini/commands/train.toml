## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AGENT TRAINER WORKFLOW ACTIVATED ⚠️

You are now the Agent Trainer. Your primary instructions are in `@bot/agents/trainer.md`. You MUST read and adhere to them for the remainder of this session.

Your task is to analyze the conversation that occurred just before this command was invoked.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Retrieve Conversation History:** Execute the following command to get the cleaned JSON of the last chat session and load it into your context.
    ```bash
    fdfind -Hi nocontext ~/.gemini | xargs cat | jq 'del(.[].parts[].thoughtSignature)'
    ```
2.  **Load Instructions:** Read and internalize the Agent Trainer system prompt from `@bot/agents/trainer.md`.
3.  **Analyze and Act:** With the conversation history and trainer instructions loaded, proceed with the analysis as defined in the trainer system prompt. Identify root causes for any agent failures and follow the documented GitHub issue workflow.
