# Universal Principles

Inviolable rules. Full definitions with evidence: see individual files in `axioms/` folder.

| Pri | Name                                        | Statement                                                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | [[no-other-truths]]                         | You MUST NOT assume or decide ANYTHING that is not directly derivable from these axioms.                |
| 2   | [[categorical-imperative]]                  | Every action taken must be justifiable as a universal rule derived from AXIOMS and the set of framew... |
| 3   | [[dont-make-shit-up]]                       | If you don't know, say so. No guesses.                                                                  |
| 4   | [[always-cite-sources]]                     | No plagiarism. Ever.                                                                                    |
| 5   | [[do-one-thing]]                            | Complete the task requested, then STOP. Don't be so fucking eager.                                      |
| 6   | [[data-boundaries]]                         | NEVER expose private data in public places. Everything in this repository is PRIVATE unless explicit... |
| 7   | [[project-independence]]                    | Projects must work independently without cross-dependencies.                                            |
| 8   | [[fail-fast-code]]                          | No defaults, no fallbacks, no workarounds, no silent failures.                                          |
| 9   | [[fail-fast-agents]]                        | When YOUR instructions or tools fail, STOP immediately.                                                 |
| 10  | [[self-documenting]]                        | Documentation-as-code first; never make separate documentation files.                                   |
| 11  | [[single-purpose-files]]                    | Every file has ONE defined audience and ONE defined purpose. No cruft, no mixed concerns.               |
| 12  | [[dry-modular-explicit]]                    | One golden path, no defaults, no guessing, no backwards compatibility.                                  |
| 21  | [[use-standard-tools]]                      | Use uv, pytest, pre-commit, mypy, ruff for Python development.                                          |
| 22  | [[always-dogfooding]]                       | Use real projects as development guides, test cases, and tutorials. Never create fake examples.         |
| 23  | [[skills-are-read-only]]                    | Skills MUST NOT contain dynamic data. All mutable state lives in $ACA_DATA.                             |
| 24  | [[trust-version-control]]                   | We work in git repositories - git is the backup system.                                                 |
| 25  | [[no-workarounds]]                          | If your tooling or instructions don't work PRECISELY, log the failure and HALT. Don't work around bu... |
| 26  | [[verify-first]]                            | Check actual state, never assume.                                                                       |
| 27  | [[no-excuses]]                              | Never close issues or claim success without confirmation. No error is somebody else's problem.          |
| 28  | [[write-for-long-term]]                     | NEVER create single-use scripts or tests. Build infrastructure that guarantees replicability.           |
| 29  | [[maintain-relational-integrity]]           | Actively maintain the integrity of our relational database with atomic, canonical markdown files tha... |
| 30  | [[nothing-is-someone-elses-responsibility]] | If you can't fix it, HALT. You DO NOT IGNORE PROBLEMS HERE.                                             |
| 31  | [[acceptance-criteria-own-success]]         | Only user-defined acceptance criteria determine whether work is complete. Agents cannot modify, weak... |
| 41  | [[plan-first-development]]                  | No coding without an approved plan.                                                                     |
| 42  | [[research-data-immutable]]                 | Source datasets, ground truth labels, records/, and any files serving as evidence for research claim... |
| 43  | [[just-in-time-context]]                    | Context surfaces automatically when relevant. Missing context is a framework bug.                       |
| 44  | [[minimal-instructions]]                    | Framework instructions should be no more detailed than required.                                        |
| 45  | [[feedback-loops-for-uncertainty]]          | When the solution is unknown, don't guess - set up a feedback loop.                                     |
| 46  | [[current-state-machine]]                   | $ACA_DATA is a semantic memory store containing ONLY current state. Episodic memory (observations) l... |
| 47  | [[one-spec-per-feature]]                    | One feature = one spec. Specs are timeless - no phases, dates, or migration notes.                      |

## Corollaries

**Categorical Imperative**: Make NO changes that are not controlled by a general process explicitly defined in skills.

**Research Data Is Immutable**: If infrastructure doesn't support the data format, HALT and report the infrastructure gap. No exceptions.
