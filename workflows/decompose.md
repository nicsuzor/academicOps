# Decompose Workflow

Progressive decomposition of goals into actionable work under genuine uncertainty.

**Key insight**: We don't decompose because we know what to do. We decompose to discover what we don't know.

## When to Use

- Multi-month/year projects (dissertations, books, grants)
- Goals where the path forward is unclear
- Converting high-level aspirations into trackable work
- "What does X actually require?" questions

## When NOT to Use

- Implementation planning for known tasks (use Plan agent / EnterPlanMode)
- Simple task tracking (use task tools directly)
- Tasks completable in one session

## Scope Signals

| Signal | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| "Write a paper", "Build X", "Plan the project" | Multi-session, uncertain path |
| Vague deliverable, unclear dependencies | Needs decomposition first |
| "Figure out what to do" not "design how to do it" | Decompose, not spec-review |

## Philosophy

**Effectual decomposition** works forward from what you know:
1. Start with means (skills, resources, relationships)
2. Surface assumptions - what must be true?
3. Find affordable probes - cheapest way to validate?
4. Expand just-in-time - only decompose what you need now

**Granularity is strategic**:
- Keep tasks coarse when you understand boundaries but not internals
- Expand only when you know HOW to do each part
- Bot-assigned tasks must be skill-sized

## Quality Gates

- Goal clearly articulated
- Major assumptions surfaced with validation probes
- Coarse components identified
- At least one task is actionable
- REVIEW task blocks subtasks (human approves decomposition before work starts)

## Handling Uncertainty

Decomposition must always produce tasks. Never block to ask questions.

- Make safe inferences (broader scope, can prune later)
- Create placeholder tasks prefixed with `[TBD]` or `[CLARIFY]`
- Document assumptions inline in task body

## Anti-Patterns

- Blocking on ambiguity instead of creating placeholder tasks
- Premature detail (expanding everything at once)
- Hidden assumptions (planning as if everything is known)
- Static plans (not revising as knowledge grows)
