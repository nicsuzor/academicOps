# Decompose

Break goals into actionable work under genuine uncertainty.

## Routing Signals

- Multi-month projects (dissertations, books, grants)
- "What does X actually require?"
- Vague deliverable, unclear dependencies
- Path forward is unknown

## NOT This Workflow

- Known tasks, clear steps → [[design]] or [[minor-edit]]
- Completable in one session → [[minor-edit]]

## Unique Steps

1. Articulate the goal clearly
2. Surface assumptions (what must be true?)
3. Find affordable probes (cheapest way to validate?)
4. Create coarse components (don't over-decompose)
5. Ensure at least one task is actionable NOW
6. Create REVIEW task that blocks subtasks (human approves before work starts)

## Key Principle

We decompose to **discover what we don't know**, not because we know what to do.

## Anti-Patterns

- Expanding everything at once (premature detail)
- Blocking on ambiguity (create placeholder tasks instead)
- Hidden assumptions (planning as if everything is known)
