# TDD Cycle

Red-green-refactor for any testable code change.

## Routing Signals

- Implementing new features
- Fixing bugs (reproduce with test first)
- Refactoring existing code

## NOT This Workflow

- Non-code changes → [[minor-edit]]
- Exploratory work → [[decompose]]
- Test infrastructure itself

## Unique Steps

None. This IS the [[base-tdd]] pattern. Reference it directly.
