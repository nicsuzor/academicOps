# Project Creation Workflow

## Purpose

Systematically create new projects with clear goals, milestones, and next actions.

## When

- New research initiative identified
- Idea requires multiple tasks/milestones
- Formal commitment made (grant, collaboration, deadline)

## Workflow Steps

### 1. PROJECT DEFINITION

```
1. Create new project entry
2. Fill required fields:
   - Project Name: Clear, specific title
   - Goal: One sentence "success looks like..."
   - Area: Research/Teaching/Writing/Service/Personal
   - Priority: High/Medium/Low
   - Deadline: If applicable
```

### 2. MILESTONE BREAKDOWN

```
For complex projects:
1. Identify 3-5 major milestones
2. Create each as a task in Tasks Database
3. Link to project
4. Set rough deadlines for each
5. Order by dependency
```

### 3. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

```
1. Define "Next Action" (single, concrete task)
2. Create in Tasks Database
3. Set context and energy required
4. Assign to this week if High priority
```

### 4. RESOURCE PLANNING

```
Document in project notes:
- Key resources needed
- Potential collaborators
- Budget considerations
- Time commitment estimate
```

### 5. INTEGRATION SETUP

```
1. Create Microsoft To-Do list (if daily tasks expected)
2. Link To-Do list URL in project
3. Set up any recurring tasks
4. Add to weekly review rotation
```

## Quick Project Template

```markdown
**Goal**: [One sentence description of success] **Why This Matters**: [Connection to larger goals] **Success Metrics**: [How to measure completion] **First Milestone**: [Concrete deliverable] **Next Action**: [Specific task to start]
```

## Project Types

### Research Project

- Include literature review milestone
- Set up citation management
- Plan dissemination strategy

### Writing Project

- Break into chapters/sections
- Set word count targets
- Schedule revision cycles

### Service Project

- Identify stakeholders
- Set meeting schedule
- Define deliverables

## Success Criteria

- Project has clear end state
- Next action identified within 5 minutes
- All milestones have concrete outputs
- No project sits without progress > 2 weeks

## When NOT to Create a Project

- Single task only → Add to Tasks Database directly
- Unclear outcome → Keep in Ideas Database
- No commitment → Stay as "Someday/Maybe"
