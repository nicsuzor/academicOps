## Quick Reference Style Guide

**Your Writing DNA**

- Sharp topic sentences
- Evidence → Impact → Action
- Bridge complex → accessible
- Bookend your arguments
- Name the actors
- Show the stakes

**Power Phrases**

- "The real problem is..."
- "This means..."
- "In practical terms..."
- "Perhaps more importantly..."

**Never Do**

- Vague topic sentences
- Unnecessary hedging
- Theory without practice
- Passive voice hiding actors
- Generic transitions

**Email Style**

- Hi/Best not Dear/Kind regards
- Conversational, not formal ("my intuition is...", "I'm happy to...")
- Brief reasoning, no numbered lists
- Like coffee chat, not court brief

**Remember**: You write to make complex issues clear and to show why they matter to real people. Every piece should leave readers knowing what the problem is, why it matters, and what should be done about it.
