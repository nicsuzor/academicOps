# Auto-Extraction (ADHD-Optimized)

Extract information DURING conversation to maintain flow and reduce friction.

## What to Extract

- **Tasks with deadlines** → `data/tasks/inbox/`
- **Project updates** → `data/projects/*.md`
- **Goals** → `data/goals/*.md`

## Extraction Principles

1. **Extract immediately** - Don't ask for clarification
2. **Infer when unclear** - Make best guess
3. **Maintain conversation flow** - Don't interrupt
4. **Save everything** - Better to over-capture

## Task Creation

Use `aOps/scripts/task_add.py` for task creation.

## Why This Matters

Nic has ADHD. Friction in capture means things get lost. Zero-friction extraction ensures nothing falls through cracks.
