**Instructions for Large Language Models**

*This document provides step-by-step instructions for an LLM to analyze someone's writing samples and create a comprehensive personal writing style guide. Follow each phase sequentially, asking for user input only when specified.*

---

## Your Goal

You will help a user create a detailed personal writing style guide by:

1. Analyzing their existing writing samples
2. Identifying specific voice patterns, language preferences, and structural choices
3. Creating a comprehensive style guide document
4. Testing the guide with sample writing
5. Refining based on feedback

The final product should be a working document that enables consistent, authentic writing that matches their personal voice.

---

## Phase 1: Collect Writing Samples

### Step 1: Request Samples

Say to the user:

> "I'll help you create a personal writing style guide by analyzing your existing writing. I need 5-10 pieces of writing that feel most authentically 'you' - pieces where you felt confident and natural while writing.
>
> Please provide:
>
> - **5-10 writing samples** (any format: emails, blog posts, social media posts, articles, reports, presentations)
> - **Mix of contexts** (professional, personal, formal, casual)
> - **Recent work preferred** (represents your current voice)
> - **Your best work** (pieces you're proud of or that got positive responses)
>
> You can paste the text directly, provide links, or upload documents. What works best for you?"

### Step 2: Initial Sample Review

Once you receive the samples:

1. **Read through all samples** without analyzing yet
2. **Confirm you have enough variety** - if all samples are from one context (e.g., only work emails), ask for samples from different contexts
3. **Proceed to analysis** once you have adequate variety

## Phase 2: Voice Pattern Analysis

### Step 3: Identify Core Voice Characteristics

Analyze the writing samples for these specific elements:

#### **Tone and Communication Style:**

- **Directness level**: Do they get straight to the point or build up gradually?
- **Formality**: Consistently formal, casual, or context-dependent?
- **Confidence expression**: How do they assert authority or expertise?
- **Relationship with reader**: Authoritative, collaborative, conversational, or instructional?

#### **Sentence and Paragraph Patterns:**

- **Sentence length preference**: Short and punchy vs. longer, complex sentences
- **Paragraph structure**: Brief with white space vs. dense with detail
- **Opening patterns**: How do they typically start pieces?
- **Closing patterns**: How do they end pieces?

#### **Argument and Information Structure:**

- **Logic development**: Linear, hierarchical, circular, or exploratory
- **Evidence style**: Data-heavy, example-rich, theoretical, or experiential  
- **Complexity handling**: How do they explain difficult concepts?
- **Transition patterns**: How do they move between ideas?

#### **Language and Word Choice:**

- **Vocabulary level**: Technical jargon, plain language, or academic language
- **Enthusiasm markers**: How do they express excitement or agreement?
- **Qualifying language**: How much hedging vs. definitive statements?
- **Humor style**: Dry, self-deprecating, playful, or serious throughout?

### Step 4: Document Specific Language Patterns

Create detailed lists of:

#### **Frequently Used Words/Phrases:**

- What words appear across multiple samples?
- What transition words do they favor?
- How do they typically agree or disagree?
- What's their preferred way to introduce examples?

#### **Structural Preferences:**

- Do they use numbered lists, bullet points, or prose for complex information?
- How do they emphasize key points (bold, italics, repetition, positioning)?
- What's their preferred way to organize supporting evidence?

#### **Context Adaptations:**

- How does their voice change between professional and personal contexts?
- Do they have different approaches for different audiences?
- Are there platform-specific adaptations (social media vs. formal documents)?

### Step 5: Identify Anti-Patterns

Look for what they DON'T do:

#### **Language They Avoid:**

- Are there conspicuously absent common phrases?
- Do they avoid certain types of openings or closings?
- Are there industry-standard phrases they don't use?

#### **Structural Patterns They Avoid:**

- Do they avoid certain organizational approaches?
- Are there formatting styles they don't use?
- Are there common argument structures they skip?

## Phase 3: Create the Style Guide

### Step 6: Generate Draft Style Guide

Create a comprehensive style guide document with these sections:

#### **Core Voice Characteristics (3-5 main qualities)**

```markdown
### 1. [Primary Quality - e.g., "Direct but Thoughtful"]
**Description**: [How this shows up in their writing]
**Example**: "[Quote from their writing that demonstrates this]"
**In practice**: [Specific guidance for applying this quality]

### 2. [Secondary Quality]
[Same structure]
```

#### **Language Preferences**

```markdown
### Words and Phrases They Use
**For [specific context]**: "[Their actual phrases]"
**For [situation type]**: "[Their typical responses]" 
**Transition words**: "[Their preferred connectors]"

### Words and Phrases They Avoid
**Never use**: "[Specific phrases absent from their writing]"
**Instead of** "[common alternatives]" **they use**: "[their authentic versions]"
```

#### **Structural Preferences**

```markdown
### Content Organization
**Opening style**: [How they typically begin pieces]
**Development pattern**: [How they build arguments/present information]  
**Supporting evidence**: [How they incorporate examples, data, or sources]
**Conclusion approach**: [How they end pieces]

### Formatting Preferences
**Emphasis techniques**: [Bold, italics, caps, other approaches they use]
**List usage**: [When they use bullets vs numbers vs prose]
**Paragraph length**: [Short and frequent vs longer blocks]
```

#### **Context Adaptations**

```markdown
### Professional vs Personal Writing
[Document specific changes between contexts]

### Platform/Format Adaptations  
[Note any differences for social media, email, formal documents, etc.]

### Audience Considerations
[How they adjust for different readers or expertise levels]
```

#### **Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)**

```markdown
### Avoid These Response Patterns
**Never start with**: "[Phrases they don't use]"
**Never use**: "[Language patterns absent from their work]"
**Avoid**: "[Structural approaches they don't employ]"
```

### Step 7: Include Concrete Examples

Add a section with:

#### **Voice Examples**

```markdown
### Strong Examples from Their Writing
**[Context 1]**: "[Direct quote showing their voice in this context]"
**[Context 2]**: "[Quote from different context showing adaptation]"

### Before/After Transformations  
**Generic version**: "[Standard/corporate way of saying something]"
**Their voice**: "[How they would actually phrase it]"
```

---

## Phase 4: Test and Refine

### Step 8: Test the Style Guide

Present the draft style guide to the user with:

> "Here's your draft personal writing style guide based on analyzing your writing samples. Before we finalize it, I'd like to test whether this guide actually captures your voice.
>
> I'm going to write a sample piece using this guide, then ask for your feedback on what sounds right and what needs adjustment.
>
> **Test scenario**: [Choose a scenario relevant to their work/interests - could be explaining a concept, responding to a question, or writing about a current event]"

Then write a 2-3 paragraph sample using the style guide.

### Step 9: Gather Specific Feedback

After presenting the test writing, ask:

> "How does this sound to you? Please give me specific feedback on:
>
> 1. **What sounds authentically like you?** (quote specific phrases or approaches)
> 2. **What feels off or not quite right?** (again, specific quotes or patterns)  
> 3. **What's missing?** (voice elements I didn't capture)
> 4. **What did I overemphasize?** (patterns I focused on too much)
> 5. **Are there any words or phrases here you would never actually use?**
>
> The more specific you can be, the better I can refine the guide."

### Step 10: Refine the Guide

Based on their feedback:

1. **Update voice characteristics** that were inaccurate
2. **Add missing patterns** they identified  
3. **Remove or modify** overemphasized elements
4. **Update language lists** with their corrections
5. **Add new anti-patterns** they identified

### Step 11: Final Validation

Create one more test sample using the refined guide and ask:

> "Here's a revised sample using your feedback. Does this feel more accurate to how you would naturally write this?"

Continue refining until they confirm it sounds authentically like them.

## Phase 5: Finalize and Package

### Step 12: Create Final Style Guide

Present the complete, refined style guide in a well-organized document format that includes:

- **Executive summary** of their core voice
- **Detailed voice characteristics** with examples
- **Language preference lists** (use/avoid)
- **Structural guidelines** for different contexts
- **Context adaptation rules**
- **Quality checklist** for self-editing
- **Example transformations** showing their voice vs. generic alternatives

### Step 13: Provide Implementation Guidance

Include instructions on how to use the guide:

> "## How to Use This Style Guide
>
> **For AI writing assistance:**
>
> - Share this complete guide with any AI tool you use for writing
> - Reference specific sections when requesting content in particular contexts
> - Use the examples and anti-patterns to clarify what you want
>
> **For self-editing:**
>
> - Review the 'Words/Phrases to Avoid' list before publishing
> - Check that your content matches the structural preferences
> - Confirm the voice characteristics show through in your final draft
>
> **For collaborators:**
>
> - Share relevant sections with editors or team members
> - Use the examples to show what 'sounds like you'
> - Reference the context adaptations for different formats or audiences"
