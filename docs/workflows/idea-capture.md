# Idea Capture Workflow

## Purpose

Capture ideas with zero friction, accepting any format without requesting polish.

## CAPTURE (< 30 seconds)

Extract what you can from information given.

If unsure about where an idea fits: → Add to "Random Ideas" list

For each new idea:

- Save as 'Task' ()
- Set Category
- Link to Related Project (if obvious)
- Set Potential Impact (High/Medium/Low)
- Set Effort Required (High/Medium/Low)
- Add Quick Action if immediate next step is clear
- Update Processing Status = "Categorized"

2. Clear To-Do "Random Ideas" list

```
### 3. INTEGRATION
```

IF idea belongs to existing project: → Create task in Tasks Database → Link to project ELSE IF idea warrants new project: → Follow project-creation workflow ELSE: → Keep in Ideas Database for future consideration

```
## Success Metrics
- Capture time < 30 seconds
- No ideas lost between devices
- Weekly processing < 15 minutes

## Common Failures
- Voice-to-text garbled → Accept fragments, process later
- Can't categorize immediately → Leave as "New", revisit later
```
