# Daily Planning Workflow

## Purpose

Set up each day for focused work by selecting tasks based on energy, context, and priorities.

## When

Morning routine (or night before)

## Workflow Steps

### 1. REVIEW TODAY'S LANDSCAPE

```
1. Check calendar for fixed commitments
2. Note energy level (High/Medium/Low)
3. Identify available time blocks
```

### 2. SELECT TASKS

```
IF energy is HIGH:
  → Prioritize Deep Work tasks
  → Select 1-2 major cognitive tasks
ELSE IF energy is MEDIUM:
  → Mix of Admin and lighter Deep Work
  → Select 3-4 medium tasks
ELSE IF energy is LOW:
  → Focus on Quick Wins and Admin
  → Select 5-6 small tasks

ALWAYS:
- Include at least one "Quick Win" for momentum
- Match task contexts to time blocks
- Respect the "no more than 3 high-priority items" rule
```

### 3. EXPORT TO MOBILE

```
1. For each selected task:
   - Add to Microsoft To-Do "Today" list
   - Include project context in task name
   - Set due time if time-specific
```

### 4. SET INTENTION

```
- Identify ONE primary outcome for the day
- Write it at top of To-Do list
- This becomes your north star
```

## Context Matching Guide

- **Deep Work**: 2+ hour blocks, morning preferred
- **Admin**: 30-60 minute blocks, any time
- **Communication**: End of day or between tasks
- **Quick Wins**: Fill gaps, build momentum

## Success Metrics

- Planning takes < 10 minutes
- Tasks match available energy
- End day with primary outcome achieved

## Common Adjustments

- Low energy day → Defer Deep Work, focus on Quick Wins
- Surprise meeting → Shift to mobile-friendly tasks
- Blocked on task → Switch context, maintain momentum
