# Hooks Documentation

**This file is deprecated.** The canonical hooks documentation is now at:

→ **[aops-core/skills/framework/references/hooks.md](/aops-core/skills/framework/references/hooks.md)**

That document covers:

- Claude Code hook system (configuration, lifecycle events, schemas)
- Gemini CLI hook system (updated February 2026)
- academicOps hook router architecture
- GateResult vs CanonicalHookOutput design rationale
- Gate implementation guide (Registration Triad)
- Python hook conventions and anti-patterns
