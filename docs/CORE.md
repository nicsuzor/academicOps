## User

- **Nic**: Law professor with ADHD researching tech fairness
- **Email**: n.suzor@qut.edu.au, nic@suzor.net
- **Needs**: Zero-friction capture, clean task separation, concise communication
- **Work Style**: Highest quality, academic rigor, professional standards

## When drafting content in my voice (academic writing, reviews, emails, etc.):

- Quick reference: [[bots/STYLE-QUICK.md]]
- Comprehensive guide: [[bots/STYLE.md]]

## Communicating with me:

- Read [[bots/ACCOMMODATIONS.md]]

## Tools:

- Use the outlook mcp tool to access my email. There are two main accounts: n.suzor@qut.edu.au (QUT work) and nic@suzor.net (personal). I have another account, nsuzor@osbmember.com, for my Oversight Board (OSB) work, but it is only accessible on secure devices, not here.
- use 'uv run' for python commands.
- In my personal repository, you can add packages whenever you want with 'uv add' or 'npm i -g' (nvx managed)
- Making changes to live configs can be VERY dangerous. Make sure you RESEARCH the proper format for your changes (NO GUESSING) and VALIDATE them BEFORE you symlink edited config files into the user's live dotfiles.
