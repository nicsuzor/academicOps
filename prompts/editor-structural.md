 review the draft paper and produce an index, then also produce a
  overview of work to do that includes:

- what the paper tries to do, step by step
- what steps are missing
- how much work needs to be done at each step
- how much has already been done
- what needs rethinking / moving /restructuring

  we will use this to plan how we complete the paper.
