# QUT School of Law Student Guidelines for Responsible and Ethical Use of Generative AI in Law Units

## Information, Communication and Technology Principles

These guidelines provide clarity on applying QUT's [Information,
Communication Technology (ICT)
Principles](https://qutvirtual4.qut.edu.au/group/staff/teaching/digital-learning-tools/genai-supported-tools#h2-0)
to learning and assessment in the School of Law. The ICT principles
provide a framework for evaluating Generative AI (GenAI) use, focusing
on intellectual property, data privacy, bias and human oversight. These
guidelines apply the ICT Principles in a manner consistent with the
Supreme Court of Queensland's Practice Direction on [Accuracy of References in Submissions](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf)
(Practice Direction on Accuracy of References) and the [Use of
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Guidelines for Responsible Use
by Non-Lawyers (Guidelines for
Non-Lawyers)](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf),
which reflect expectations of responsible GenAI use in courts and
tribunals in Queensland.

The following four principles are explained under separate headings
below:

1. Be aware that most material uploaded to GenAI tools will be
   protected by copyright or intellectual property rights

2. Do not upload confidential or private information to GenAI tools

3. Review all GenAI outputs for bias, stereotypes and inaccuracies

4. You are accountable for ensuring that GenAI outputs are fit for
   purpose

### Principle 1: Copyright and Intellectual Property

You must not share content with GenAI tools that is created by staff,
students or third parties unless it is in the public domain or you have
received written consent. At QUT, students retain ownership of the
intellectual property they create. Uploading another student's work to a
GenAI tool may infringe on their copyright and intellectual property
rights and/or their information privacy rights. You should also be aware
that uploading third party copyrighted material may infringe the rights
of the creator of that material. For instance, using GenAI to summarise
or rephrase content from textbooks, articles, or other intellectual
property could breach copyright unless the use is clearly permissible
and properly acknowledged. Additionally, QUT owns all learning, teaching
and assessment materials that staff create in the course of their
employment. These materials may only be uploaded to QUT-supported GenAI
tools if you receive written consent. Further guidance can be found in
Section 4 of the [Guidelines for Non-Lawyers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf).

### Principle 2: Data Security and Privacy

You must not upload confidential or private information to GenAI tools.
Some GenAI tools incorporate user inputs into their training datasets,
which can inadvertently enable public access to sensitive or proprietary
information. Anything entered into a public GenAI chatbot should be
treated as if it were being published to the world, as these tools often
retain and reuse user inputs to generate responses for other users. This
creates a real risk of breaching confidentiality obligations or
institutional privacy requirements. Further guidance can be found in
Section 2 of the [Guidelines for Non-Lawyers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf).

### Principle 3: Biases, Stereotypes, and Inaccuracies

You must cross-check every GenAI output against primary legal materials
and reputable academic sources. GenAI tools generate content based on
the data they have been trained on, which may include biased or outdated
information. This can result in outputs that reinforce stereotypes or
present inaccuracies, even if they appear plausible at first glance.
Failure to cross-check outputs risks perpetuating stereotypes,
reinforcing inequities, and undermining academic integrity. Further
guidance can be found in Sections 1 and 4 of the [Guidelines for Non-Lawyers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf).

### Principle 4: Human Accountability and Oversight

You are responsible for the accuracy, tone, and appropriateness of the
AI-generated content you rely upon. These tools can misinterpret
context, omit nuance, and produce text that is misleading, offensive, or
legally incorrect. Before using or sharing AI-generated material, you
must rigorously review, edit, and verify it against authoritative
sources. This includes checking for fabricated citations, ensuring
compliance with institutional and legal standards, and confirming that
the content is suitable for its intended audience. Further guidance can
be found in the [Practice Direction on Accuracy of
References](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf)
and Section 3 of the [Guidelines for Non-Lawyers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf).

Where you are permitted to use GenAI in law assessments, you are
expected to critically evaluate and rigorously verify any AI-generated
content you include in your assessment submissions. This requirement
reflects [[ICT Principle 3 (Bias, Stereotypes and
Inaccuracies)]{.underline}](https://qutvirtual4.qut.edu.au/group/staff/teaching/digital-learning-tools/genai-supported-tools#h2-0),
the [Practice Direction on Accuracy of
References](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf),
and Section 3 of the [Guidelines for Non-Lawyers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf),
which highlight that GenAI outputs may contain bias, reinforce
stereotypes, or present outdated or inaccurate information. You are
responsible for the accuracy, tone, and appropriateness of any content
you submit, regardless of whether GenAI was used.  

## Prohibited Uses of GenAI in Learning, Teaching and Assessment at QUT

While GenAI can support learning and assessment in specific, controlled
ways, there are circumstances where its use is not permitted. You must
always check your assessment instructions (including Canvas) and if
unsure, confirm with your unit coordinator whether GenAI use is
permitted for each task. GenAI use may be prohibited to protect academic
integrity, confidentiality, and compliance with policy. Using GenAI in
these contexts risks breaching privacy, intellectual property rights, or
QUT policies, and may result in serious consequences. The following
examples outline situations where GenAI must not be used:

- **Entering intellectual property into GenAI tools:** You must not
  share the learning and teaching materials provided by staff with any
  GenAI tool without written consent. For example, if a unit
  coordinator releases an exemplar for an assignment, this must not be
  uploaded to GenAI tools, unless you receive written consent to
  upload the information to a GenAI tool that QUT supports.

- **Entering confidential or sensitive information into GenAI tools:**
  You must not share confidential information with GenAI tools. For
  example, medical records, academic transcripts or misconduct
  referrals should not be uploaded to GenAI tools.

- **Presenting GenAI legal analysis as authoritative:** You must not
  rely on GenAI outputs without verification. For example, submitting
  AI-generated analyses of case law or legislation without human
  verification is an inappropriate use of GenAI.

For further guidance, please refer to QUT's [Academic Integrity Policy (MOPP)](https://mopp.qut.edu.au/document/view.php?id=146).

## Permitted Uses of GenAI in Teaching and Learning at QUT

With the exception of the prohibitions outlined above, you may use GenAI
ethically and responsibly in law units when permitted by the Unit
Coordinator, in line with the principles outlined above. However, when
using GenAI you must exercise your professional judgement, knowledge and
critical thinking to produce high-quality academic work. In line with
ICT Principles 4 and 7, the [Practice Direction on Accuracy of
References in
Submissions](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf)
and Section 3 of the [Guidelines for Non-Lawyers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/798375/Artificial-Intelligence_Guidelines-for-Non-Lawyers.pdf),
you are accountable for ensuring the accuracy of any AI-generated
content used in assessment.
