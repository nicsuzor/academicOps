# QUT School of Law Staff Guidelines for Responsible and Ethical Use of Generative AI for Learning, Teaching and Assessment 

## Information, Communication and Technology Principles

These guidelines provide directions on applying QUT's [Information,
Communication Technology (ICT)
Principles](https://qutvirtual4.qut.edu.au/group/staff/teaching/digital-learning-tools/genai-supported-tools#h2-0)
in learning, teaching and assessment in the School of Law. The ICT
principles provide a framework for evaluating Generative AI (GenAI) use,
focusing on intellectual property, data privacy, bias, human oversight,
equity and accessibility. These guidelines apply the ICT Principles in a
manner consistent with the Supreme Court of Queensland's Practice
Direction on [Accuracy of References in
Submissions](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf)
(Practice Direction on Accuracy of References) and the [Use of
Generative AI Guidelines for Judicial
Officers](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf)
(Judicial Guidelines) to promote consistency with responsible use
expectations in the legal profession.

The following five principles are explained under separate headings
below:

1.  Be aware that most material uploaded to GenAI tools will be
    protected by copyright or intellectual property rights

2.  Do not upload confidential or private information to GenAI tools

3.  Review all GenAI outputs for bias, stereotypes and inaccuracies

4.  Educators are accountable for ensuring that GenAI outputs are fit
    for purpose

5.  Students must have equitable access to GenAI tools

### Principle 1: Copyright and Intellectual Property

Educators must not upload student-created material to GenAI tools
without their written consent. At QUT, students retain ownership of the
intellectual property they create. Uploading student work to a GenAI
tool may infringe on their copyright and intellectual property rights
and/or their information privacy rights. Staff should also be aware that
uploading third party copyrighted material may infringe the rights of
the creator of that material. For instance, using GenAI to summarise or
rephrase content from textbooks, articles, or other intellectual
property could breach copyright unless the use is clearly permissible
and properly acknowledged. Additionally, QUT owns all learning, teaching
and assessment materials that staff create in the course of their
employment. These materials may only be uploaded to QUT-supported GenAI
tools. Further guidance can be found in Section 2 of the [Judicial
Guidelines](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf).

### Principle 2: Data Security and Privacy

Staff must not upload confidential or private information to public
GenAI tools, including Microsoft Copilot. Some GenAI tools incorporate
user inputs into their training datasets, which can inadvertently enable
public access to sensitive or proprietary information. Anything entered
into a public GenAI chatbot should be treated as if it were being
published to the world, as these tools often retain and reuse user
inputs to generate responses for other users. This creates a real risk
of breaching confidentiality obligations or institutional privacy
requirements. Where possible, disable chat history features, and never
use public AI chatbots for material that is not already in the public
domain. Further guidance can be found in Section 2 of the [Judicial
Guidelines](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf).

### Principle 3: Biases, Stereotypes, and Inaccuracies

Educators must cross-check every GenAI output against primary legal
materials and reputable academic sources before they are used for
learning, teaching and assessment purposes. GenAI tools generate content
based on the data they have been trained on, which may include biased or
outdated information. This can result in outputs that reinforce
stereotypes or present inaccuracies, even if they appear plausible at
first glance. Failure to cross-check outputs risks perpetuating
stereotypes, reinforcing inequities, presenting incorrect information
and undermining academic integrity. Further guidance can be found in
Sections 1 and 4 of the [Judicial
Guidelines](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf).

### Principle 4: Human Accountability and Oversight

Staff are responsible for the accuracy, tone, and appropriateness of the
AI-generated content they distribute. These tools can misinterpret
context, omit nuance, and produce text that is misleading, offensive, or
legally incorrect. Under no circumstances should AI outputs be accepted
at face value. Before using or sharing AI-generated material, educators
must rigorously review, edit, and verify it against authoritative
sources. This includes checking for fabricated citations, ensuring
compliance with institutional and legal standards, and confirming that
the content is suitable for its intended audience. Further guidance can
be found in the [Practice Direction on Accuracy of
References](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf)
and Section 6 of the [Judicial
Guidelines](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf).

### Principle 5: Equity and Accessibility 

All students must be able to access any GenAI tools used in teaching and
learning. Educators cannot require students to use GenAI tools that QUT
has not adopted. QUT-supported tools are evaluated to meet accessibility
standards and educators are expected to design content that is
accessible within platforms like Canvas. This ensures that all students
can engage fully with learning materials. Further guidance can be found
on the Digital Workplace and in Sections 1, 4 and 6 of the [Judicial
Guidelines](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf).

## Permitted Uses of GenAI in Teaching and Learning 

With the exception of the prohibitions outlined below, GenAI may be
ethically and responsibly used in teaching, learning, and assessment in
the Law School. However, in line with ICT Principles 4 and 7, the
[Practice Direction on Accuracy of References in
Submissions](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/882064/sc-pd-5-pf-2025.pdf)
and Section 6 of the [Judicial
Guidelines](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/879714/the-use-of-generative-ai-guidelines-for-judicial-officers.pdf),
educators are accountable for ensuring the accuracy of any AI-generated
content used in teaching and learning. GenAI tools are fallible. They
misinterpret context, omit critical nuance, and generate material that
is inaccurate, inappropriate, or legally problematic. For this reason,
no AI-generated output should ever be relied upon without thorough human
review. Educators must carefully check all content for accuracy, verify
citations, ensure compliance with institutional and legal standards, and
confirm that tone and language are suitable for the intended audience.
GenAI is a support tool, not a substitute for professional judgment, and
its outputs must always be critically assessed and refined before use.

## Prohibited Uses of GenAI in Learning, Teaching and Assessment at QUT

While GenAI can support learning, teaching, and assessment in specific,
controlled ways, there are circumstances where its use is not permitted.
These restrictions exist to protect academic integrity, confidentiality,
and compliance with policy. Using GenAI in these contexts risks
breaching privacy, intellectual property rights, or professional
standards, and may result in serious consequences. If you are unsure of
whether it is appropriate to use GenAI for learning, teaching and
assessment, please contact the Director of Studies (Law) before doing
so. The following examples outline situations where GenAI must not be
used:

-   **Relying on GenAI-detection tools as decisive evidence of
    misconduct:** Educators must not use GenAI-detection outputs as the
    sole basis for academic misconduct decisions (ICT Principle 4). For
    example, educators can use Turnitin as a prompt to investigate
    misconduct, but it should not be the sole basis for referring a
    student to the Faculty of Business and Law Misconduct Committee.

-   **Entering confidential or sensitive information into GenAI tools:**
    Educators must not input student information, marking guides or
    other confidential information into GenAI tools (ICT Principle 2).
    For example, educators must not paste an academic transcript into
    Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT.

-   **Drafting summative assessment items using public GenAI tools:**
    Educators must not create assessment answers or similar materials in
    public GenAI tools, because the GenAI tool will retain this
    information and may disseminate it to others, including students
    (see ICT Principle 2).

-   **Automated grading or awarding marks:** Educators must not use
    GenAI to grade student work or assign marks, per ICT Principles 1
    and 4. For example, educators must not use GenAI tools to
    automatically grade essays.

-   **Presenting GenAI legal analysis as authoritative:** Educators must
    not present unverified GenAI outputs as definitive legal analysis to
    students (ICT Principle 4). For example, educators must not rely on
    AI generated case interpretations for the purpose of teaching
    students.
