| cc_hook | Creating or modifying Claude Code hooks | plan-mode | plugin-dev:hook-development |
| cc_mcp | MCP server configuration or integration | plan-mode | plugin-dev:mcp-integration |
| feature | Building new functionality or extending existing features | tdd | feature-dev |
| python | Python code that needs testing | tdd | python-dev |
| debug | Investigating errors, fixing bugs, diagnosing issues | verify-first | - |
| question | User asking for information or explanation (no implementation needed) | answer-only | - |
| persist | Saving knowledge, notes, or decisions to the knowledge base | direct | remember |

## Workflow Descriptions

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
