# Framework Glossary

Quick definitions for framework-specific terminology. Used by hydrator to interpret user prompts without filesystem exploration.

> **Maintenance**: Update this file when adding major framework concepts. Run `Skill(skill="audit")` to regenerate indices including this glossary. If hydrator tries to search for a term, the glossary needs updating.

## Build Pipeline & Generated Files

| **build.py**                        | `scripts/build.py` — generates platform-specific distributions from canonical sources. Maps tool names, model names, and schemas between Claude and Gemini formats. |
| **canonical source**                | Files in `$AOPS/aops-core/` (agents, skills, hooks, etc.) — the single source of truth. Always edit these, never dist artifacts.                                    |
| **dist/**                           | `$AOPS/dist/aops-gemini/`, `$AOPS/dist/aops-claude/` — generated platform-specific builds. NEVER edit directly (P#97).                                              |
| **~/.gemini/extensions/aops-core/** | Installed Gemini build output. Generated by `build.py`. Fix source + rebuild, don't edit.                                                                           |
| **~/.claude/plugins/aops-core/**    | Installed Claude build output. Generated by `build.py`. Fix source + rebuild, don't edit.                                                                           |
