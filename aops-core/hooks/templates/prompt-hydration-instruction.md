# Hydrate Before Acting

**Preliminary Step**: Invoke the **prompt-hydrator** skill to gather context.
"Read {temp_path} and provide workflow guidance."

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
Once the hydrator returns the plan, you **MUST IMMEDIATELY PROCEED** to execute it (e.g. claim task, invoke critic).
**DO NOT STOP** after hydration. This is just a context-loading step.
