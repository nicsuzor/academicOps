# Peer Review Skill

Structured review for grant/fellowship applications, journal submissions, and academic assessments.

## When to Use

- Assessment packages (ARC FT, SNSF, etc.)
- Journal/conference paper reviews
- Multiple applications to evaluate

## Phases

### 1. Setup

- Create workspace directory: `$ACA_DATA/reviews/{scheme-or-journal}/{date}/`
- Obtain assessment criteria from the funding body or journal
- Generate review template from criteria

### 2. Scaffold

- Create a task per application/submission (transcribe, draft, observe)
- Download and convert documents to markdown where possible
- Note any conflicts of interest

### 3. Execute

- Read each application against the criteria
- Draft structured assessment using the template
- Reference specific evidence from the application

### 4. Compose

- Apply professional tone: measured, evidence-based, not effusive
- Evaluate claims rather than restating them
- Lead with strengths, place concerns at end
- Use concrete examples over generalizations

## Composition Principles

- **Tone**: Professional positive, measured not effusive
- **Voice**: Evaluate claims, don't restate
- **Evidence**: Concrete examples over generalizations
- **Structure**: Lead with strengths, concerns at end
