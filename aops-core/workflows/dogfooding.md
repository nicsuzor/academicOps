# Dogfooding

Framework self-improvement during any task.

## When to Apply

- Working under uncertainty. If we don't know how to do it, but we want to try, we have to learn from the experiment.

## Decision Tree

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| One-time friction | `/log [observation]` → continue |
| Recurring pattern (3+) | Check HEURISTICS.md → `/learn` if missing |
| Blocking current task | Fix minimally, `/learn` for tracked change |
| Session end | Framework Reflection |

## Notice List

1. Routing friction - unclear workflow?
2. Missing context - what didn't surface?
3. Instruction gaps - what guidance absent?
4. Guardrail failures - what would prevent mistake?

## Key Rule

**Don't stop to fix everything.** Log with `/log`, continue working.
