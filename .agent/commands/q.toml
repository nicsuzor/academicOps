# /q - Quick Queue (No Hydration)

**Purpose**: Capture a task for later execution with minimal overhead.

## When to Use

* User says "new task: X" or "/q X"
* Quick capture of work that should NOT be executed now
* Backlog management without execution planning

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check for Duplicates (Quick Search)

Search for potentially related tasks:

```
mcp__plugin_aops-tools_task_manager__search_tasks(query="<keywords>", limit=5)
```

If a related task exists with status != "done":
* Ask user: "Found related task [ID]: [title]. Add as subtask, or create new?"
* If add: use `update_task` to append to body or decompose
* If new: proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Create Task

```
mcp__plugin_aops-tools_task_manager__create_task(
  task_title="<extracted title>",
  type="task",
  project="<infer from context or ask>",
  priority=2,
  complexity="<infer: mechanical | requires-judgment>",
  body="<any additional context from user prompt>"
)
```

### Step 3: Confirm and HALT

Report: "Queued: [task-id] - [title]"

The task is queued. That's it.

## Arguments

* `/q <description>` - Create task with description as title
* `/q` (no args) - Prompt user for task details
