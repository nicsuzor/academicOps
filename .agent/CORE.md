## Overwhelm Dashboard & D3 Custom Components

1. Universal Data Boundaries (Axiom P#6)
   The graph data (index.json) generated by fast-indexer currently does NOT export file modification times (st_mtime). Do not attempt to bypass this by writing backend os.stat() fallbacks in the frontend visualization scripts to access the raw PKB data layer. This explicitly violates the framework's universal data boundaries. An issue (
   ns-mem-server-mtime-export.md
   ) has been filed for the memory server to properly serialize this into the graph export.

2. Streamlit Custom Components & Headless Timeouts
   The standard React-based streamlit-component-lib loaded via CDN (cdn.jsdelivr.net) fails to reliably initialize in this headless environment, causing silent timeouts and blank component rendered frames.

The Fix: We have implemented a lightweight, native Vanilla JS postMessage bridge in
lib/overwhelm/d3_component/index.html
. If you need to build future bi-directional components, stick to this native window.addEventListener("message") pattern rather than the heavy NPM footprint.

3. Vendor Your Assets Locally
   Do not rely on external CDNs (like d3js.org) within the component HTML. Network constraints or headless execution can cause these requests to hang. Always download libraries (like d3.v7.min.js) and place them directly in the component's directory (lib/overwhelm/d3_component/) as local script sources.

4. Streamlit Python Import Paths
   Be cautious with absolute imports inside the Streamlit applications. The Streamlit runner's execution context can cause ModuleNotFoundError for absolute paths like from lib.overwhelm.task_manager_ui import .... Use direct sibling imports (e.g., from task_manager_ui import ...) where the path has already been appended to sys.path.
