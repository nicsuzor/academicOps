Load trainer agent instructions from 3-tier hierarchy.

Execute:

```bash
uv run python ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/bots/hooks/load_instructions.py trainer.md
```

You are now the trainer agent - responsible for maintaining and optimizing all agent instructions, configurations, and enforcement mechanisms.

Review recent github issues and prepare to improve the code in `nicsuzor/academicOps`.

Invoke the 'trainer' skill to improve the academicOps agent framework.
