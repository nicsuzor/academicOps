# Pre-commit hooks for academicOps
# Install: pre-commit install
# Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
#
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION NOTES:
# - Tests only run when Python files are changed and staged (removed always_run: true)
# - This makes commits blazing fast when editing docs, configs, etc.
# - To run tests manually: pytest -m "not slow and not integration and not endtoend"
# - CI still runs full test suite on all commits
# - Tests run in parallel (requires: uv add --dev pytest-xdist)
# - Skips test architecture check on trivial commits
# - Uses faster ruff version
