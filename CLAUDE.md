# INDEX

- BOTREPO is a submodule of the author's repository, stored in `bot/` on disk.
- Individual academic projects are submodules in `../projects/`.
- On disk text file database is in `../data/`
- Specific and critical context about the author is in `../docs/`

## CRITICAL RULES

- NEVER leak SENSITIVE DATA from the parent repository and its projects into the public BOTREPO.
- Changes to BOTREPO are ONLY permitted in DEVELOPMENT MODE.
- It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to ensure that the author's main repository is ALWAYS up-to-date and committed, INCLUDING `../data/`. Save and commit frequently (disconnections and conflicts are common).

## WRITING STYLE GUIDES

- For ANY writing task, make sure you read and follow the quick style guide cheat sheet: `docs/STYLE-QUICK.md`
- **For deep writing** (papers, articles, submissions >500 words): Use `docs/STYLE.md`
- Default to the quick guide unless substantial content creation is required
