Read `./agents/_CORE.md` for core axioms and project instructions.
- We're in the `@nicsuzor/academicOps` repository (public). 
This is the main academicOps automation framework repository where we've been working on:
  - Deployment architecture tests (Issue #128)
  - CLAUDE.md just-in-time loading (Issue #120)
  - All the core agent instructions, skills, and infrastructure (ALWAYS ONGOING)
- We do evidence-based changes and experiments. NEVER try to fix a problem based on a single data point! Associate errors with a general category of error or failure mode, don't treat them as discrete (we're building a SYSTEM!) Save evidence of failures to our experiment tracker and to github issues, highly preferring existing issues wherever possible.
