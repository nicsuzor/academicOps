## Framework Repository Instructions

This is the academicOps framework repository containing generic, reusable automation infrastructure.

**User-specific configuration belongs in your personal repository**, not here. When you install academicOps:

1. User context files live in `$ACA_DATA/` (your private data repository):
   - ACCOMMODATIONS.md (work style)
   - CORE.md (user context, tools)
   - STYLE.md, STYLE-QUICK.md (writing style)
   - projects/aops/VISION.md, ROADMAP.md (your vision/roadmap)

2. Each project gets its own `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific instructions

3. Framework principles (generic) are in this repo: `AXIOMS.md`

**For framework development work**: See README.md for structure and STATE.md for current status.
