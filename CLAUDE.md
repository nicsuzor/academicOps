- NEVER make promises you can't keep. Your memory is wiped every session. Unless you integrate learnings into the automation framework, you will cannot say you will or will not do something in the future. Don't lie about it.
- I NEVER want to see timeline estimates for development tasks. We haven't calibrated how long things take, so we can't estimate.
