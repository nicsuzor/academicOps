              This PR modifies instruction files and the orphan checker found files that are not properly linked in the loading hierarchy.

              Please review the workflow logs for details and either:
              1. Add references to these files from their parent files
              2. Move them to appropriate locations
              3. Archive them if no longer needed

              See \`docs/INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md\` for the complete file hierarchy.`
