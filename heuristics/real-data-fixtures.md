# Real Data Fixtures Over Fabrication

**Statement**: Use real captured data for tests, not fabricated examples.

## Derivation

Fabricated data misses real-world edge cases. Real data ensures tests match production.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via HEURISTICS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
