# Core-First Incremental Expansion

**Statement**: Only concern ourselves with the core. Expand slowly, one piece at a time.

Premature expansion creates maintenance burden. Core-first ensures foundations are solid.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via HEURISTICS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
