# Real Fixtures Over Contrived Examples

**Statement**: Test real scenarios, not contrived examples that pass surface checks.

## Derivation

Contrived examples miss edge cases. Real fixtures ensure tests reflect production.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Convention via docs/testing-patterns.md. See [[RULES.md]].
