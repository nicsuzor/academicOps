# Light Instructions via Reference

**Statement**: Framework instructions should be brief and reference authoritative sources rather than hardcoding content.

## Derivation

Hardcoded content drifts from source. References ensure agents get current information.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via HEURISTICS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
