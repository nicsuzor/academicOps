# Semantic vs Episodic Storage

**Statement**: Classify content before creating. Semantic (timeless truth) goes to $ACA_DATA. Episodic (observations) goes to bd issues.

## Derivation

Mixing memory types creates confusion. Clear classification enables appropriate retrieval.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via HEURISTICS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
