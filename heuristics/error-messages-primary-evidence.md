# Error Messages Are Primary Evidence

**Statement**: When an error occurs, quote the error message exactly. Never paraphrase.

## Derivation

Paraphrased errors lose critical details. Exact quotes enable precise debugging and searchability.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Injected via HEURISTICS.md at SessionStart. See [[RULES.md]].
