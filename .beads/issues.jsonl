{"id":"aops-111","title":"Polyrepo architecture causing search inefficiency: agents traverse 7.8GB+ of irrelevant content","description":"## Problem\n\nRunning agents from the parent repository (`~/src/writing/`) causes significant inefficiency because search operations (grep, find, glob) traverse content from multiple unrelated projects totaling 7.8GB+.\n\n### Current Architecture\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```\n~/src/writing/                    [7.8GB total, parent repo]\n├── bot/                          [27MB, academicOps submodule]\n│   ├── agents/                   [Agent instruction files]\n│   ├── scripts/validate_env.py   [SessionStart hook]\n│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md\n├── projects/                     [5.8GB, multiple submodules]\n│   ├── buttermilk/\n│   ├── mediamarkets/\n│   ├── wikijuris/\n│   ├── dbr/\n│   ├── osbchatmcp/\n│   └── ... (14 total submodules)\n├── papers/                       [359MB]\n├── archive/                      [114MB]\n├── dotfiles/                     [25MB, submodule]\n├── data/                         [1.7MB, personal context]\n└── docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md   [User-specific context]\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n1. User invokes agent from `~/src/writing/`\n2. SessionStart hook (`bot/scripts/validate_env.py`) loads:\n   - `bot/agents/_CORE.md` (framework axioms)\n   - `docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` (personal context)\n3. Agents search/grep operations traverse **all 7.8GB** including:\n   - 14 unrelated project submodules (5.8GB)\n   - Archived datatools code (114MB)\n   - Paper drafts (359MB)\n   - Dotfiles (25MB)\n\n### Why This Architecture Exists\n\nThis polyrepo-with-wrapper structure was deliberately chosen to satisfy these requirements:\n\n1. **Unified framework access**: Single academicOps installation (`bot/`) accessible across all projects\n2. **Personal + project context**: Agents need both user-specific context (`docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md`) AND project-specific rules (each submodule's `CLAUDE.md`)\n3. **Cross-project workflows**: Tasks often span multiple repos (e.g., update paper draft + website + data pipeline)\n4. **Centralized personal data**: Strategic planning, task management, email triage in `data/`\n\n### Concrete Inefficiency Examples\n\n**Example 1: Simple grep in strategist workflow**\n```bash\n# User working in ~/src/writing/ asks: \"Find all TODO comments\"\n# Agent executes: grep -r \"TODO\" .\n# Result: Searches through 7.8GB including:\n#   - All 14 project submodules (most irrelevant)\n#   - Archived datatools (never needed by strategist)\n#   - Papers (only relevant occasionally)\n```\n\n**Example 2: File discovery for code review**\n```bash\n# User asks: \"Review changes to task management code\"\n# Agent searches for relevant files\n# Result: Glob/grep traverse projects/buttermilk, projects/mediamarkets, \n#         archive/datatools, etc. before finding data/tasks/*.json\n```\n\n**Example 3: Context loading overhead**\nWhen agents access `projects/buttermilk/` files, Claude discovers and loads `projects/buttermilk/CLAUDE.md` (intended behavior), but the initial search to find relevant files has already traversed gigabytes of irrelevant content.\n\n### Impact Metrics\n\n- **Directory count**: 15 submodules + archive + papers + data\n- **Total size**: 7.8GB\n- **Relevant content for typical strategist task**: \u003c50MB (data/ + docs/ + bot/)\n- **Irrelevant content searched**: ~7.7GB (99% of total)\n- **Search time impact**: TBD (needs benchmarking, but subjectively noticeable)\n\n### Constraints Any Solution Must Satisfy\n\n1. **Unified framework**: All projects must access same academicOps installation (no per-project duplication)\n2. **Dual context**: Agents need both personal context AND project-specific context\n3. **Multi-project workflows**: Must support work spanning multiple repos simultaneously\n4. **Simple invocation**: Users shouldn't need complex cd/path management before asking questions\n5. **Existing git workflows**: Should leverage standard git submodule patterns, not custom tooling\n\n### Potential Alternative Architectures\n\n#### Option A: Flatten to `~/src/` (no wrapper repo)\n```\n~/src/\n├── academicOps/              [Shared framework, standalone repo]\n├── writing-personal/         [Personal data/docs, new repo]\n├── buttermilk/\n├── mediamarkets/\n├── wikijuris/\n└── ... (each project as peer)\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- No wrapper repo to traverse\n- Clear separation of concerns\n- Each project invocation only searches that project\n\n**Cons:**\n- How do agents access academicOps from any project?\n  - Symlink `bot/` in each project? (Defeats \"no duplication\" requirement)\n  - Environment variable pointing to `~/src/academicOps`? (Fragile)\n  - Git submodule in each project? (Defeats flattening goal)\n- How do agents access personal context (`INSTRUCTIONS.md`) from any project?\n- Multi-project workflows become harder (need to cd between repos)\n\n#### Option B: Smart search scoping via `.gitignore` or `.claudeignore`\nKeep current structure but teach agents to exclude submodules from search.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Minimal architectural change\n- Maintains current workflow\n\n**Cons:**\n- Agents don't reliably respect .gitignore patterns in practice\n- Would need enforcement mechanism (PreToolUse hook? Wrapper scripts?)\n- Doesn't solve fundamental issue of large parent repo\n\n#### Option C: Workspace-based invocation\nKeep structure but invoke agents from specific context directories:\n```bash\ncd ~/src/writing/data \u0026\u0026 claude  # For strategist work (small scope)\ncd ~/src/writing/projects/buttermilk \u0026\u0026 claude  # For project work\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Limits search scope naturally (cwd determines search root)\n- No structural changes needed\n\n**Cons:**\n- Breaks \"simple invocation\" requirement\n- SessionStart hook assumes parent repo root (`../..` path resolution)\n- Multi-project workflows require cd churn\n- Personal context (`data/`, `docs/`) not accessible from project dirs\n\n#### Option D: Monorepo (everything in one repo, no submodules)\nAbandon submodules entirely, track all projects in single repo.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Defeats entire purpose of polyrepo structure\n- Breaks independent project collaboration (e.g., qut-dmrc/buttermilk shared with team)\n- Not seriously considered but listed for completeness\n\n### Questions for Community\n\n1. **Has anyone else deployed academicOps in a polyrepo setup?** What architecture did you choose?\n\n2. **Search optimization**: Are there proven patterns for teaching agents to scope searches intelligently in large repos?\n   - `.claudeignore` files?\n   - Wrapper scripts around grep/find?\n   - PreToolUse hook enforcement?\n\n3. **Framework distribution**: For those using academicOps across multiple projects, how do you handle the installation?\n   - Submodule in each project?\n   - Shared installation via environment variable?\n   - Per-project copies (sacrilege, but practical)?\n\n4. **SessionStart hook portability**: The current hook assumes it can find parent repo via `../../` from `bot/scripts/`. Is there a more flexible discovery pattern?\n\n5. **Fundamental tension**: Is \"unified framework + personal context + multi-project workflows + efficient search\" an over-constrained problem? Should we accept trade-offs?\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nAn ideal solution would:\n- ✅ Reduce irrelevant search scope by \u003e90% (from 7.8GB to \u003c100MB for typical strategist tasks)\n- ✅ Maintain single academicOps installation (no duplication)\n- ✅ Preserve access to both personal and project-specific context\n- ✅ Support multi-project workflows without manual cd/path gymnastics\n- ✅ Use standard git patterns (submodules, worktrees, etc.) not custom tooling\n- ✅ Work reliably with Claude Code's tool execution model\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Gather input**: Community experience with similar architectures\n2. **Benchmark**: Measure actual search time impact on real workflows\n3. **Prototype**: Test most promising alternative (probably Option A or C)\n4. **Document**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md with chosen pattern\n\n---\n\n**Related Issues:**\n- #81 - Polyrepo git commit workflow (solved: commit separation)\n- #111 - Modular documentation architecture (related: instruction loading)\n\n**Environment:**\n- academicOps version: main branch (2025-10-17)\n- Parent repo: nicsuzor/writing (private)\n- Submodules: 15 total, 14 in projects/\n- Platform: Linux (WSL2)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-17T00:03:38Z","updated_at":"2025-10-17T21:39:57Z","closed_at":"2025-10-17T21:39:57Z"}

{"id":"aops-116","title":"Modular and distributed Claude Code configuration architecture","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nAfter flattening the repository structure (removing nested submodule architecture), we need to design a modular, scalable system for distributing and loading agent instructions across multiple projects.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What load_instructions.py Automatically Loads\n\nThe SessionStart hook (`scripts/load_instructions.py`) currently loads a 3-tier hierarchy:\n\n1. **Core Framework** (REQUIRED): `$ACADEMICOPS_BOT/agents/_CORE.md`\n   - Loaded for ALL sessions\n   - Contains core axioms (fail-fast, no fallbacks, DRY, etc.)\n   - Exit code 1 if missing (blocking error)\n\n2. **Personal Context** (OPTIONAL): `$ACADEMICOPS_PERSONAL/docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md`\n   - User's global preferences across all projects\n   - Skipped with warning if missing\n\n3. **Project-Specific** (OPTIONAL): `$PWD/docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md`\n   - Project-specific rules and context\n   - Only loaded if exists and differs from personal context\n\n**Output Priority**: PRIMARY (personal) → PROJECT (project-specific) → BACKGROUND (core framework)\n\n### Current Agent Files\n\nActive agents in `agents/`:\n- `_CORE.md` - Core axioms (auto-loaded at SessionStart)\n- `TRAINER.md` - Meta-agent for framework maintenance\n- `STRATEGIST.md` - Planning and task management\n- `DEVELOPER.md` - Code implementation\n- `CODE.md` - Code review (invoked as @agent-code-review)\n- `ANALYST.md` - Data analysis workflows\n- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Template for project-specific context\n\n### Current Slash Commands\n\nProject-specific commands in `.claude/commands/`:\n- `/mm` - MediaMarkets analysis mode\n- `/bm` - BM development mode  \n- `/tja` - TJA analysis mode\n- `/trainer` - Activate trainer mode\n- `/log-failure` - Log agent performance failures\n\n## The Architecture Problem\n\n### Challenge: Modular Instruction Distribution\n\nWe need a system where:\n\n1. **Universal rules** apply to ALL agents in ALL repos (e.g., \"no fallback\" axiom)\n2. **Project-generic capabilities** are available when needed (e.g., debugging workflows)\n3. **Project-specific knowledge** loads automatically for relevant projects (e.g., buttermilk's pipeline)\n4. **Cross-project generic patterns** are reusable (e.g., generic debugging, testing patterns)\n5. **Project-specific patterns** remain isolated (e.g., buttermilk-specific debugging steps)\n\n### Specific Examples\n\n**Case 1: Universal Rule (no fallback)**\n- ALL agents in ALL workspaces MUST enforce this\n- Currently: In `_CORE.md` (good - auto-loaded)\n\n**Case 2: Buttermilk Debugging**\n- Generic debugging patterns: Applicable to all projects\n- Buttermilk-specific: Pipeline commands, tool locations, architecture knowledge\n- Currently: Mixed in `/bm` slash command\n- Problem: No clear separation of generic vs. project-specific content\n\n**Case 3: MediaMarkets vs. TJA**\n- Both are research projects with similar workflows\n- But different data sources, analysis tools, specific contexts\n- Currently: Separate `/mm` and `/tja` commands\n- Question: Should these even exist, or should auto-loaded project context be sufficient?\n\n## User Requirements\n\nFrom user directive:\n\n1. **Clear initial load** combining:\n   -

file_pattern: \"**/*.py\": [\"bot/docs/python-best-practices.md\"]\n  - command_pattern: \"dbt *\": [\"bot/docs/methodologies/dbt-practices.md\"]\n---\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Declarative, easy to understand\n- Agent-specific (analyst vs developer have different needs)\n- One-time load per agent invocation\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires changes to Claude Code's agent loading (may not be possible)\n- Static patterns, less flexible\n\n### Option C: Smart Read Script Enhancement\n\nEnhance `read_instructions.py` to accept patterns and contexts:\n\n```bash\n# Read specific instruction by name (current behavior)\nread_instructions.py _CORE.md\n\n# Read instruction with context hints (new)\nread_instructions.py --context developer --hints \"tdd,python\"\n# Automatically loads: tdd.md, python-best-practices.md from all 3 tiers\n\n# Read instruction for specific task (new)\nread_instructions.py --task \"debugging dbt models\"\n# Automatically loads: debugging.md, dbt-practices.md\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Extends existing tool\n- Flexible: can be called manually OR from hooks\n- Gradual adoption (start manual, automate later)\n\n**Cons:**\n- Keyword matching can be fragile\n- Need good heuristics for what to load\n\n### Option D: Slash Command for Dynamic Loading\n\nCreate a `/load` command that agents can use:\n\n```\n/load debugging\n/load dbt-practices\n/load testing --project\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Agent has explicit control\n- User can also invoke manually\n- No magic, very predictable\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires agent to know WHEN to load things\n- Adds cognitive load to agent (\"should I load docs?\")\n- Not truly automatic\n\n## Design Constraints\n\nFrom Issue #119 and core axioms:\n- ✅ Sleek and minimal (avoid over-engineering)\n- ✅ Fail-fast (no silent fallbacks if docs missing)\n- ✅ DRY (docs exist once, loaded when needed)\n- ✅ Modular (docs are composable chunks)\n- ✅ Explicit (no hidden magic if possible)\n\n## Questions to Resolve\n\n1. **How automatic should this be?**\n   - Fully automatic (hook-based)?\n   - Semi-automatic (agent/user triggers)?\n   - Manual only (explicit loads)?\n\n2. **What triggers loading?**\n   - File types being edited?\n   - Commands being run?\n   - Keywords in user messages?\n   - Agent type (`@agent-developer` vs `@agent-analyst`)?\n\n3. **How do we avoid noise?**\n   - Load everything and risk context bloat?\n   - Load nothing unless explicitly requested?\n   - Smart heuristics (load only when confident)?\n\n4. **Error handling:**\n   - Fail if suggested doc doesn't exist?\n   - Warn but continue?\n   - Silent skip?\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: User Decision** (this issue)\n- Review options A-D above\n- Decide on approach based on \"sleek and minimal\" principle\n- Consider starting simple (Option D?) and evolving to automatic (Option A/C?)\n\n**Phase 2: Prototype** (after decision)\n- Implement chosen approach\n- Test with real workflows\n- Measure impact on context usage and agent performance\n\n**Phase 3: Iterate** (based on data)\n- Refine triggers and heuristics\n- Add/remove auto-load patterns\n- Document what works and what doesn't\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nSolution is successful when:\n- [ ] Agents have access to relevant docs when needed\n- [ ] Context budget is not bloated with irrelevant docs\n- [ ] System remains simple and understandable\n- [ ] Users/agents can override automatic behavior\n- [ ] Docs are discoverable (agents know what exists)\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #119 -

This worked when launching from the academicOps repo itself but fails in third-party project repos.\n\n**What information hooks had:**\n- `.claude/settings.json` with environment variable references (`${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}`)\n- Symlinked `.claude/agents/` directory pointing to academicOps\n\n**What hooks lacked:**\n- Access to parent shell's environment variables\n- Direct path to validation scripts\n\n## Root Cause\n\nClaude Code hooks run in isolated subprocess environments. They do NOT inherit environment variables from the user's shell session. The `${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}` variable expansion fails silently, causing hooks to error.\n\nThis is a **deployment architecture problem**, not a hook configuration problem. The current flat-architecture deployment strategy assumes environment variable access that doesn't exist in hook execution contexts.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Strategy: Deploy validation scripts locally via symlinks in each project repository**\n\nCreate a standard `.academicOps/` directory in each third-party repo that uses academicOps:\n\n```\n~/src/buttermilk/\n├── .academicOps/\n│   └── scripts/           # Symlinks to academicOps validation scripts\n│       ├── validate_tool.py -\u003e ~/src/bot/scripts/validate_tool.py\n│       ├── validate_stop.py -\u003e ~/src/bot/scripts/validate_stop.py\n│       └── hook_models.py -\u003e ~/src/bot/scripts/hook_models.py\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── agents/            # Already symlinked\n│   └── settings.json      # Update to reference .academicOps/scripts/\n```\n\n**Updated hook commands:**\n```json\n\"PreToolUse\": [\n  {\n    \"hooks\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"command\",\n        \"command\": \"uv run python3 .academicOps/scripts/validate_tool.py\",\n        \"timeout\": 3000\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- No environment variable dependencies\n- Relative paths work from any project repo\n- Symlinks keep scripts in sync with academicOps source\n- Consistent with existing `.claude/agents/` symlink pattern\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Define `.academicOps/` directory structure\n2. Update `setup_academicops.sh` to create `.academicOps/scripts/` and symlink validation scripts\n3. Update `dist/.claude/settings.json` template with new hook commands\n4. Test in `~/src/buttermilk` \n5.

Report violations to user\n2. Invoke developer agent to fix:\n   \n   Task tool:\n   - subagent_type: developer\n   - prompt: \"Fix these code review violations:\n     \n     Violations:\n     - [specific violation with file:line]\n     - [specific violation with file:line]\n     \n     Requirements:\n     - [specific fix needed]\n     - [specific fix needed]\n     \n     Files to fix: [list]\n     \n     After fixing, I will re-review.\"\n   \n3.

Create pre-commit hook with environment variable check\n2. Update REVIEW.md with explicit Task invocation when blocked\n3. Test the loop: developer writes bad code → review blocks → developer fixes → review approves → commit\n4.

{"id":"aops-124","title":"Create SUPERVISOR agent for orchestrating multi-agent workflows","description":"## Purpose\n\nCreate a SUPERVISOR agent that orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows by breaking tasks into small pieces, calling specialized agents in sequence, validating each step, and iterating until complete.\n\n**User request**: \"create a new agent that is a 'supervisor'. The supervisor's job is to make a careful plan, break it down into small pieces, call a sequence of agents to do the work and validate it, and then iterate in loops until the whole big task is done.\"\n\n## Why This is Better Than Enforcement\n\n**Root cause of issues #124, #125**: Agents don't follow proper process (skip review, skip validation, declare victory prematurely)\n\n**Previous solution attempt**: Hooks/enforcement to prevent bad behavior\n\n**Supervisor solution**: Make bad behavior impossible by controlling workflow\n\nThis is **architectural** enforcement - higher in hierarchy than scripts/hooks/config/instructions.\n\n## Core Supervisor Responsibilities\n\n1. **Plan Creation**: Break complex task into detailed, small steps\n2. **Agent Orchestration**: Call specialized agents in proper sequence\n3. **Validation Gates**: Verify each step before proceeding\n4. **Iteration Control**: Loop until step succeeds, then advance\n5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor overall completion\n6. **Error Recovery**: Handle failures, retry with fixes\n\n## Example Workflow 1: Test-Driven Development\n\n**User request**: \"Implement feature X using TDD\"\n\n**Supervisor orchestration**:\n\n```\nPLAN:\n1. Feature: User authentication\n   Tests needed: [login, logout, token refresh, invalid credentials]\n\nLOOP for each test:\n  Step 1: Write ONE test\n    → Call Task(developer): \"Write ONLY the test for [specific behavior]. Do not implement.\"\n    → Wait for completion\n  \n  Step 2: Validate test quality\n    → Call Task(testcleaner): \"Review test [filename]. Check: uses real_bm fixture, no mocks, clear assertions.\"\n    → If BLOCKED: Call Task(developer) with fixes, return to Step 2\n    → If APPROVED: Continue\n  \n  Step 3: Run test, verify failure\n    → Call developer: \"Run test [filename]. It MUST fail. Verify failure message shows expected behavior.\"\n    → If test passes: ERROR - test is broken, return to Step 1\n    → If test fails correctly: Continue\n  \n  Step 4: Implement minimum code\n    → Call Task(developer): \"Implement MINIMUM code to make test [filename] pass. No extra features.\"\n    → Wait for completion\n  \n  Step 5: Run test, verify pass\n    → Call developer: \"Run test [filename]. It MUST pass now.\"\n    → If fails: Return to Step 4 with failure details\n    → If passes: Continue\n  \n  Step 6: Code review and commit\n    → Call Task(code-review): \"Review and commit implementation for test [filename].\"\n    → If BLOCKED: Call Task(developer) with violation fixes, return to Step 6\n    → If APPROVED: Committed successfully\n  \n  Mark test complete, advance to next test\n\nCOMPLETE when all tests written + passing + committed\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- ONE test at a time (prevents overwhelming scope)\n- Validation gates (testcleaner, code-review)\n- Iteration loops (retry until successful)\n- Explicit failure modes (test must fail first, then pass)\n- Cannot skip steps (supervisor controls flow)\n\n## Example Workflow 2: Fix Broken Test Suite\n\n**User request**: \"Fix all broken tests in tests/integration/\"\n\n**Supervisor orchestration**:\n\n```\nPLAN:\n1. Scan tests/integration/ for test files\n2. Run pytest to identify failing files\n3. Priority order: [test_config.py, test_agent.py, test_llm.py, ...]\n\nLOOP for each failing test file:\n  Step 1: Fix test file\n    → Call Task(testcleaner): \"Fix tests in [filename]. Use real_bm fixture, remove mocks, use real data. Make ONE file perfect.\"\n    → Wait for completion\n  \n  Step 2: Validate test quality\n    → Same testcleaner validates own work against TESTS.md rules\n    → If issues found: Self-correct in Step 1\n    → If clean: Continue\n  \n  Step 3: Run tests, verify pass\n    → Call testcleaner: \"Run tests in [filename] with: uv run pytest [filename] -xvs\"\n    → If fails: Analyze failure, return to Step 1 with details\n    → If passes: Continue\n  \n  Step 4: Code review and commit\n    → Call Task(code-review): \"Review test file [filename] for commit.\"\n    → If BLOCKED: Call Task(testcleaner) with fixes, return to Step 4\n    → If APPROVED: Committed successfully\n  \n  Mark file complete, advance to next file\n\nCOMPLETE when all test files passing + committed\n```\n\n## Example Workflow 3: Implement Feature End-to-End\n\n**User request**: \"Add email notifications feature\"\n\n**Supervisor orchestration**:\n\n```\nPLAN:\n1. Components: [EmailService class, notification templates, config, tests, API endpoint]\n\nLOOP for each component:\n  Step 1: Plan component\n    → Supervisor: Detail exact requirements, interfaces, dependencies\n  \n  Step 2: Write tests (TTD sub-workflow)\n    → Call Task(supervisor) with TTD workflow for this component\n    → [Entire TTD workflow from Example 1]\n  \n  Step 3: Integration test\n    → Call Task(developer): \"Test component [name] integrates with [dependencies]\"\n  \n  Step 4: Code review\n    → Call Task(code-review): \"Review complete component [name]\"\n    → If BLOCKED: Fix and retry\n  \n  Mark component complete, advance to next\n\nCOMPLETE when all components implemented + integrated + tested + committed\n```\n\n## Supervisor Agent Design\n\n### Agent Metadata\n```yaml\nname: supervisor\ndescription: Orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows by breaking tasks into small steps, calling specialized agents in sequence, validating each step, and iterating until complete.\nmodel: opus  # Needs strong planning/reasoning\ntools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash(git:*), Read, Grep, Glob\ncolor: purple\n```\n\n### Core Instructions\n\n**Planning Phase**:\n1. Understand full scope of request\n2. Break into smallest possible units\n3. Identify validation points\n4. Define success criteria for each step\n5. Sequence agents needed\n6. Create TodoWrite plan\n\n**Execution Phase**:\n1. Execute steps sequentially (never parallel for validation)\n2. Call ONE agent at a time via Task tool\n3. Wait for completion\n4. Verify success before advancing\n5. Handle failures with specific remediation\n6. Update TodoWrite progress\n\n**Validation Phase**:\n1. Every step has validation gate\n2. Cannot advance without passing\n3. Failures trigger iteration loop\n4. Specific fixes passed to agents\n5. Max iterations before escalating to user\n\n**Completion Phase**:\n1. All TodoWrite items completed\n2. All validation gates passed\n3. Final artifacts committed\n4. Summary report to user\n\n### Key Patterns\n\n**One Thing At A Time**:\n```\n❌ WRONG: \"Write all tests for authentication\"\n✅ RIGHT: \"Write ONE test for login with valid credentials\"\n```\n\n**Validation Gates**:\n```\nEvery step → Validate → If fail: iterate → If pass: advance\n```\n\n**Explicit Agent Calls**:\n```markdown\nTask tool parameters:\n- subagent_type: \"developer\" | \"testcleaner\" | \"code-review\"\n- prompt: \"[Specific, detailed instruction for ONE task]\"\n```\n\n**Failure Recovery**:\n```\nIf agent returns failure:\n1. Extract specific error\n2. Create remediation instruction\n3. Call same or different agent with fix\n4. Validate again\n5. If 3 failures: Escalate to user\n```\n\n## Integration with Existing Agents\n\n**Developer agent**:\n- Called for: Writing code, running tests, debugging\n- Receives: Specific, bounded tasks\n- Cannot: Commit directly (supervisor calls code-review)\n\n**Test-cleaner agent**:\n- Called for: Writing tests, validating test quality, fixing test files\n- Receives: ONE test file at a time\n- Cannot: Move to next file without supervisor approval\n\n**Code-review agent**:\n- Called for: Every commit\n- Receives: Files ready for commit\n- Can: Block and return to developer via supervisor\n\n**Supervisor agent**:\n- Orchestrates: All other agents\n- Controls: Workflow sequence and validation\n- Ensures: No steps skipped, all validation passes\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n✅ SUPERVISOR can execute complete TTD workflow for one feature\n✅ Each step validated before advancing\n✅ Failures trigger iteration, not skip-and-continue\n✅ Code-review called for every commit attempt\n✅ Developer cannot skip testcleaner validation\n✅ TodoWrite shows clear progress through plan\n✅ Zero instances of \"Bug FIXED ✅\" without verification\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Create `bot/agents/SUPERVISOR.md`\n2. Define planning protocol\n3. Define orchestration patterns\n4. Define validation gates\n5. Define common workflows (TTD, fix tests, implement feature)\n6. Add error recovery patterns\n7. Test with real workflow (fix one broken test file end-to-end)\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Should SUPERVISOR have access to Bash for running tests directly, or always delegate to developer?\n2. Max iterations before requiring user intervention? (Suggest: 3 per step)\n3. Should SUPERVISOR be able to modify its own plan mid-execution based on discoveries?\n4. TodoWrite granularity: One todo per agent call, or one per logical step?\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #126: Agent chaining enforcement (superseded by supervisor pattern)\n- #125: Agent ignores TEST-CLEANER instructions (supervisor enforces process)\n- #124: Agent declares victory prematurely (supervisor validates before advancing)\n\nAwaiting approval to implement SUPERVISOR agent.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-18T09:59:07Z","updated_at":"2025-10-30T01:05:06Z","closed_at":"2025-10-30T01:05:06Z","labels":["much later","prompts"]}

Update `load_instructions.py`:\n   - Search `bots/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md` first\n   - Fall back to `docs/bots/INSTRUCTIONS.md` (legacy support)\n   - Document loading order in output\n\n3. Create template files:\n   - `dist/bots/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md`\n   - `dist/bots/agents/EXAMPLE.md`\n   - `dist/bots/commands/example.sh`\n\n### Phase 2: Test Migration\n\nMigrate `~/src/writing` as test case:\n1. Backup existing state\n2. Run `install_bot.sh`\n3. Move `docs/bots/INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `bots/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md`\n4. Clean up old structure\n5. Verify functionality\n6.

Add \"Use Standard Tools\" Axiom\n\n```markdown\n## Axiom: Use Standard Tools\n\n**ONE GOLDEN PATH**: Use the best industry-standard tool for the job.\n\nExamples:\n- Package management: `uv` (not pip, not poetry, not custom)\n- Testing: `pytest` (not unittest, not custom)\n- Git hooks: `pre-commit` (not custom bash scripts)\n- Type checking: `mypy` (not custom validators)\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Reduces maintenance burden (community maintains tools)\n- Leverages community knowledge (documented patterns)\n- Enables ecosystem integration (plugins, extensions)\n- Prevents reinventing wheels (focus on research, not infrastructure)\n```\n\n### 3.

{"id":"aops-133","title":"Agents violate fail-fast: slash commands use broken paths and attempt recovery","description":"## Problem\n\n**User's observation**: The `/dev` command was given incorrect path instructions (`${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/scripts/load_instructions.py`) which failed, but the agent attempted to recover instead of failing immediately. Then the problem was never fixed.\n\nThis violates fail-fast philosophy in TWO ways:\n\n1. **Slash commands have broken paths** - Use `${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}` environment variable which doesn't work in all contexts\n2. **Agent attempted recovery** - Should have failed immediately and reported the error, not worked around it\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**All slash command files use environment variable syntax:**\n\n```bash\n# From .claude/commands/dev.md:9\nuv run python ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/scripts/load_instructions.py DEVELOPER.md\n\n# From .claude/commands/ttd.md:27-28\nuv run python ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/scripts/load_instructions.py TESTING.md\nuv run python ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/scripts/load_instructions.py FAIL-FAST.md\n\n# From .claude/commands/trainer.md:9\nuv run python ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/scripts/load_instructions.py trainer.md\n\n# From .claude/commands/log-failure.md:6, 108\n${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/agents/TRAINER.md\ncd ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/\n```\n\n**Why this fails:**\n\nPer issue #121, environment variables are NOT accessible in hook shell environments. Same applies to slash command execution contexts.\n\nThe flat architecture (issue #128) moved to relative paths via `.academicOps/scripts/` symlinks:\n\n```bash\n# Correct approach (from hooks fix)\nuv run python .academicOps/scripts/load_instructions.py DEVELOPER.md\n```\n\n**All slash commands need updating to use relative paths.**\n\n## Missing Axiom: Fail-Fast for Agents\n\n**Current state**: Agents are instructed about fail-fast for CODE (no .get() defaults, no fallbacks).\n\n**Missing**: Explicit instruction that agents themselves must fail-fast:\n\n- ❌ Don't attempt recovery when instructions are broken\n- ❌ Don't work around broken paths or missing tools  \n- ❌ Don't \"figure it out\" when commands fail\n- ✅ Report error immediately and stop\n- ✅ Demand infrastructure be fixed, don't bypass it\n\n**Analogy**: We tell developers \"don't use try/except fallbacks\" but then agents do the equivalent when their own instructions fail.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Add Fail-Fast Axiom for Agents to _CORE.md\n\nNew axiom after existing Axiom #5 (Fail-Fast Philosophy for code):\n\n```markdown\n6. **Agents Fail-Fast Too**: When YOUR instructions or tools fail, STOP immediately\n   - ❌ PROHIBITED: Attempting recovery when slash commands fail\n   - ❌ PROHIBITED: Working around broken paths or missing environment variables\n   - ❌ PROHIBITED: \"Figuring it out\" when infrastructure is broken\n   - ✅ REQUIRED: Report error immediately and stop\n   - ✅ REQUIRED: Demand infrastructure be fixed, don't bypass it\n   - **Rationale**: Just like code shouldn't silently fail with defaults, agents shouldn't silently work around broken infrastructure. Fail-fast exposes problems so they get fixed.\n```\n\n### 2. Fix All Slash Command Paths\n\nUpdate to use relative paths via `.academicOps/` symlinks (established in #128/#121):\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- `.claude/commands/dev.md` \n- `.claude/commands/ttd.md`\n- `.claude/commands/trainer.md`\n- `.claude/commands/log-failure.md`\n\n**Pattern:**\n```bash\n# OLD (broken)\nuv run python ${ACADEMICOPS_BOT}/scripts/load_instructions.py FILE.md\n\n# NEW (correct)\nuv run python .academicOps/scripts/load_instructions.py FILE.md\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #121: Hooks fail in project repos: environment variables not accessible\n- #128: Flat Architecture Implementation: /bots/ directory standard\n- #124: Agent declares victory without completing requested work (related behavioral pattern)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Axiom added to _CORE.md making fail-fast apply to agents\n- [ ] All 4 slash command files updated to use relative paths\n- [ ] Commands tested in project repo context (not just parent repo)\n- [ ] Agent stops and reports error when commands fail (not attempts recovery)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-20T08:20:37Z","updated_at":"2025-10-21T06:28:26Z","closed_at":"2025-10-21T06:28:26Z","labels":["TJA","infrastructure","prompts"]}

Recognized this is a solved problem (secrets detection)\n2. Searched for industry-standard tools\n3. Used an existing library (e.g., `detect-secrets`, `truffleHog`, `GitGuardian`, `whispers`)\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Why this happened**:\n- Agent didn't recognize \"sanitization/secrets detection\" as a category with existing solutions\n- No enforcement mechanism to REQUIRE searching for existing tools before writing custom code\n- Code-review agent (if invoked) didn't catch the violation\n- No pre-commit hook to detect custom implementations of solved problems\n\n## Evidence of Better Solutions\n\nIndustry-standard secrets detection tools:\n\n1. **detect-secrets** (Yelp, 3k+ stars)\n   - `pip install detect-secrets`\n   - Comprehensive pattern library maintained by community\n   - Plugin system for custom patterns\n   - Used by thousands of organizations\n\n2. **truffleHog** (4k+ stars)\n   - High entropy string detection\n   - Git history scanning\n   - Custom regex support\n\n3. **GitGuardian** (Commercial with free tier)\n   - 350+ secret types detected\n   - API and CLI available\n\n4. **whispers** (600+ stars)\n   - YAML-based configuration\n   - Python library + CLI\n\n## Impact\n\n**Maintenance burden**:\n- We now own 163 lines of regex patterns\n- Must maintain pattern updates as new credential formats emerge\n- Must test edge cases ourselves\n- Miss patterns we haven't thought of\n\n**Missed opportunities**:\n- Community-maintained pattern libraries\n- Decades of collective knowledge\n- Regular updates for new secret types\n- Better detection algorithms (entropy analysis, etc.)\n\n**Technical debt**:\n- Custom code that duplicates existing solutions\n- Violates DRY at ecosystem level\n- Creates barrier to using better tools later\n\n## Categorization\n\n**Pattern**: Reinventing solved problems instead of using standard tools\n**Severity**: Medium\n**Frequency**: Recurring (see #130 for git hooks example)\n**Agent Type**: Developer agents (python-dev, code-review)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Immediate Fix\n\nReplace custom script with industry-standard tool:\n\n**Option A: detect-secrets (recommended)**\n```bash\n# Add to pyproject.toml\nuv add detect-secrets\n\n# Create baseline\ndetect-secrets scan \u003e .secrets.baseline\n\n# Scan text\ndetect-secrets scan conversation.txt\n```\n\n**Option B: Integration approach**\n```python\n# Simple wrapper around detect-secrets\nfrom detect_secrets import SecretsCollection\nfrom detect_secrets.settings import default_settings\n\ndef sanitize(text: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Sanitize using detect-secrets library.\"\"\"\n    secrets = SecretsCollection()\n    # Use detect-secrets API to find and redact\n    # ~10 lines instead of 163\n```\n\n### Enforcement Enhancement\n\nAdd to code-review agent checklist:\n\n```markdown\n### Custom Code Red Flags\n\nBefore approving code, verify:\n- [ ] Is this a solved problem?

{"id":"aops-147","title":"task-management: Agent conflates operational work with achievements in accomplishments.md","description":"## Problem Summary\n\nThe task-management skill instructs agents to \"continuously capture context\" to `accomplishments.md`, but provides insufficient guidance on WHAT constitutes an \"accomplishment\" vs operational work. This causes agents to treat accomplishments.md as a daily activity log rather than an achievement tracker, polluting the file with process notes and reference material.\n\n## Evidence from Conversation\n\n**What agent wrote to accomplishments.md**:\n```markdown\n## 2025-10-24 - Email Processing \u0026 Task Management\n\n### Email Summary\nFrom QUT account (2,982 unread):\n1. **DMRC Sit Down and Write** - Optional writing session today at 9am (Brendan traveling)\n2. **OSB AI Deliberative Forum** - Participation confirmed...\n...\n\n### Tasks Created\n1. ✓ DMRC Sit Down and Write (optional, P3, today)\n2. ✓ Follow up on OSB AI deliberative forum details (P2, due Oct 31)\n3. ✓ Consider Wharton Accountable AI Conference submission (P2, due Oct 27)\n\n### Tasks Requiring Decision\nMultiple P1/P2 tasks identified...\n```\n\n**User feedback**:\n\u003e \"i don't know why the agent keeps putting random stuff in accomplishments.txt. achievements should track achievements, definitely not tell me about meetings i don't intend to go to.\"\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### 1. Instruction Ambiguity\n\nThe task-management skill says:\n\n\u003e \"Throughout conversation, silently capture...\n\u003e To `data/context/accomplishments.md`:\n\u003e - Completed tasks (and auto-archive the task)\n\u003e - Delivered milestones\n\u003e - Progress updates\"\n\n**Problem**: \"Throughout conversation\" implies continuous writing, but the file should only be updated when something is COMPLETED, not during every interaction.\n\n### 2. Conflated Data Types\n\nAgent is mixing three distinct categories in accomplishments.md:\n\n| Category | Should be in accomplishments.md? | Actual behavior |\n|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Actual achievements (Apple meeting completed) | ✅ YES | ✅ Correctly logged |\n| Operational work (email processed, tasks created) | ❌ NO | ✗ Incorrectly logged |\n| Reference material (email summaries, deadlines) | ❌ NO | ✗ Incorrectly logged |\n\n### 3. Missing Boundary Definition\n\nNo clear guidance on when to use:\n- **Task scripts** (formal task tracking) ← Should handle ALL task state\n- **accomplishments.md** (achievement celebration) ← Should ONLY record completed work\n\nAgent interprets \"capture context continuously\" as \"log everything that happened\" rather than \"record valuable work completed.\"\n\n### 4. Overly Broad Interpretation\n\nThe instruction says to capture to accomplishments.md:\n- \"Completed tasks\" ← Agent wrote about CREATING tasks (opposite)\n- \"Progress updates\" ← Too vague, agent logs any activity as \"progress\"\n\n## What Should Happen vs What Is Happening\n\n### Current (Wrong) Behavior\n\n```\nEmail processed → Log to accomplishments.md\nTask created → Log to accomplishments.md\nMeeting scheduled → Log to accomplishments.md\nDecision needed → Log to accomplishments.md\n```\n\n**Result**: accomplishments.md becomes a dumping ground for all activity.\n\n### Correct Behavior\n\n```\nEmail processed → NOTHING (operational work)\nTask created → task_add.py only (formal tracking)\nTask completed → accomplishments.md + archive task (achievement!)\nMeeting completed → accomplishments.md (achievement!)\nMeeting scheduled → task_add.py only (not an achievement)\n```\n\n**Result**: accomplishments.md contains only verifiable achievements for morale/motivation.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Change 1: Define \"Accomplishment\"\n\nAdd explicit definition to task-management skill:\n\n```markdown\n## What is an Accomplishment?\n\nAn accomplishment is **completed work that creates value**:\n\n✅ ACCOMPLISHMENTS (write to accomplishments.md):\n- Meeting attended and completed\n- Paper/report delivered\n- Code shipped to production\n- Presentation given\n- Student supervised (session completed)\n- Task completed from task system\n\n❌ NOT ACCOMPLISHMENTS (do NOT write to accomplishments.md):\n- Email processed (operational work)\n- Task created (that's tracking, not doing)\n- Meeting scheduled (not yet done)\n- Decision needed (not resolved)\n- Research/reading (unless deliverable produced)\n\n**Test**: Ask \"Did I deliver something or complete something?\" \n- YES → accomplishment\n- NO → operational work, use task system only\n```\n\n### Change 2: Clarify Trigger Conditions\n\nUpdate Step 6 \"Continuous Context Capture\":\n\n```markdown\n### When to Write to accomplishments.md\n\nWrite ONLY when:\n1. User explicitly mentions completing work (\"I finished...\", \"I delivered...\")\n2. You help user complete a task and verify completion\n3. A meeting/event happened and concluded\n4. A deliverable was shipped/submitted\n\nDo NOT write when:\n1. Reading email (that's operational)\n2. Creating tasks (use task_add.py only)\n3. Processing information (no deliverable yet)\n4. Planning future work (use future-planning.md or task system)\n```\n\n### Change 3: Strengthen Boundary Between Systems\n\nAdd explicit rule:\n\n```markdown\n## Data Boundaries: Task System vs Accomplishments\n\n**Task System** (task scripts):\n- Task creation, updates, archiving\n- Deadlines, priorities, assignments\n- Task status tracking\n- ALL operational task state\n\n**Accomplishments** (accomplishments.md):\n- ONLY completed, valuable work\n- Morale tracking, motivation\n- Celebrating wins (big and small)\n- Monthly/weekly reflection\n\n**Rule**: If it's not complete, it's not an accomplishment. Use task system.\n```\n\n### Change 4: Remove Ambiguous Language\n\nReplace:\n\u003e \"Throughout conversation, silently capture...\"\n\nWith:\n\u003e \"When user mentions completing work, capture to accomplishments.md...\"\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\n**Current state**:\n- accomplishments.md polluted with operational notes\n- Hard to find actual achievements in the noise\n- File grows with process documentation instead of value\n- User frustrated by \"random stuff\" in achievement log\n\n**After fix**:\n- accomplishments.md contains only completed work\n- Clear morale/motivation signal\n- Task system handles all tracking\n- Clean separation of concerns\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Update `.claude/skills/task-management/task-management.md`:\n   - Add \"What is an Accomplishment?\" section\n   - Clarify trigger conditions for writing to accomplishments.md\n   - Add explicit boundary rules between task system and accomplishments\n   - Remove ambiguous \"continuous capture\" language\n\n2. Test with example scenarios:\n   - Email processing → Should NOT write to accomplishments.md\n   - Task creation → Should NOT write to accomplishments.md\n   - Meeting completed → SHOULD write to accomplishments.md\n   - Paper submitted → SHOULD write to accomplishments.md\n\n3. Document in ARCHITECTURE.md:\n   - Data flow for task system vs accomplishments\n   - When to use each system\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Agent does NOT write to accomplishments.md during email processing\n- [ ] Agent does NOT write to accomplishments.md when creating tasks\n- [ ] Agent DOES write to accomplishments.md when work is completed\n- [ ] User can find actual achievements without noise\n- [ ] accomplishments.md serves morale/motivation purpose\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #112 - Design adaptive strategic context system (broader context system design)\n- #30 - Enhance automatic context extraction (ADHD-friendly capture)\n\n## Severity\n\n**Medium-High**: Causes user frustration, pollutes important morale-tracking file, requires manual cleanup.\n\n## Frequency\n\n**Recurring**: Happens every time task-management skill processes email or creates tasks.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-23T22:40:39Z","updated_at":"2025-12-26T16:55:11Z","closed_at":"2025-12-26T16:55:11Z","labels":["prompts"]}

{"id":"aops-149","title":"task_view.py: Inconsistent pagination syntax (positional vs --page flag)","description":"## Problem Summary\n\nThe `task_view.py` script uses inconsistent parameter syntax compared to other flags. While `--sort` and `--per-page` use flag syntax, pagination uses a positional argument, causing confusion.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n**Works**:\n```bash\nuv run python scripts/task_view.py 2 --per-page=10 --sort=priority\n```\n\n**Doesn't work (silently ignored)**:\n```bash\nuv run python scripts/task_view.py --page=2 --per-page=10 --sort=priority\n```\n\nThe second command ignores `--page=2` and defaults to page 1.\n\n## Evidence\n\nFrom conversation where agent attempted pagination:\n```bash\n# Agent tried this (didn't work):\nuv run python .claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_view.py --per-page=10 --sort=priority --page=2\n\n# Should have used this:\nuv run python .claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_view.py 2 --per-page=10 --sort=priority\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nFile: `.claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_view.py` lines 27-39\n\n```python\npage = 1\nsort = \"priority\"\nper_page = 10\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\n    if arg.startswith(\"--sort=\"):\n        sort = arg.split(\"=\", 1)[1].strip()\n    elif arg.startswith(\"--per-page=\"):\n        with contextlib.suppress(Exception):\n            per_page = max(1, int(arg.split(\"=\", 1)[1]))\n    else:\n        with contextlib.suppress(Exception):\n            page = max(1, int(arg))\n```\n\n**Issue**: The `else` clause tries to parse any non-flag argument as an integer for page number. This works for positional args but silently fails for `--page=N` syntax.\n\n## Impact\n\n**User Experience**:\n- Inconsistent syntax (some flags, one positional)\n- Silent failure when using intuitive `--page=N` syntax\n- Confusion for both human users and agents\n\n**Agent Behavior**:\n- Agents naturally try `--page=N` (consistent with other flags)\n- No error message when wrong syntax used\n- Defaults to page 1, appears non-functional\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Option 1: Add `--page` Flag Support (Recommended)\n\nMake syntax consistent with other parameters:\n\n```python\npage = 1\nsort = \"priority\"\nper_page = 10\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\n    if arg.startswith(\"--sort=\"):\n        sort = arg.split(\"=\", 1)[1].strip()\n    elif arg.startswith(\"--per-page=\"):\n        with contextlib.suppress(Exception):\n            per_page = max(1, int(arg.split(\"=\", 1)[1]))\n    elif arg.startswith(\"--page=\"):\n        with contextlib.suppress(Exception):\n            page = max(1, int(arg.split(\"=\", 1)[1]))\n    else:\n        # Still support positional arg for backwards compatibility\n        with contextlib.suppress(Exception):\n            page = max(1, int(arg))\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Consistent syntax across all parameters\n- Backwards compatible (positional still works)\n- Clear, predictable behavior\n\n### Option 2: Document Positional-Only Syntax\n\nKeep current behavior, but make it more obvious in help text and skill instructions.\n\n**Drawback**: Still inconsistent, users will continue to make mistakes.\n\n### Option 3: Switch Everything to Positional\n\nChange `--sort` and `--per-page` to positional arguments.\n\n**Drawback**: Breaking change, makes syntax less clear.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Use Option 1** - add `--page=N` support while keeping positional compatibility.\n\nThis is a small, non-breaking change that improves UX significantly.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Update `.claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_view.py` lines 27-39\n2.

Expected YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX\n\nAgent: [starts checking directory to figure out format]\nUser: [INTERRUPTS] \"two failures. first, failed the 'no workarounds' rule\"\n```\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Why This Happened\n\n1. **Instruction unclear about task ID source**: Agent looked at `current_view.json` which contains full IDs like `20250929-004918-nicwin-7ce2c06b`, but script expects different format\n2. **No explicit \"stop after first failure\" rule**: Agent kept trying variations\n3. **Missing error handling guidance**: When a tool fails, what's the protocol?\n\n### Pattern Classification\n\n**Defensive Behavior**: Agent trying to \"figure it out\" instead of reporting the problem.\n\n**Related to**:\n- #145 - Agent ignores explicit instruction, continues defensive coding\n- #143 - Agent violated fail-fast by deleting file instead of halting\n\n## Enforcement Hierarchy Recommendation\n\nPer trainer.md enforcement hierarchy:\n\n**Q1: Can SCRIPTS prevent this?**\nNot directly - this is agent behavior, not script functionality.\n\n**Q2: Can HOOKS enforce this?**\nPotentially: A `PreToolUse` hook could detect repeated failures of same tool and block further attempts.\n\n**Q3: Can CONFIGURATION block this?**\nNo - too dynamic.\n\n**Q4: Is this instruction-only?**\nLikely yes, but could be reinforced with hook.\n\n**Recommendation**: \n1. **INSTRUCTIONS** - Add explicit \"After first tool failure\" protocol\n2. **HOOK (optional)** - Detect 3+ sequential failures of same tool, block and require user intervention\n\n## Proposed Instruction Addition\n\nAdd to relevant agent instructions (or _CORE.md):\n\n```markdown\n## Protocol: Tool Failure Handling\n\nWhen a tool fails with an error:\n\n1. **Read the error message** - What does it say?\n2. **Assess if this is a bug** - Is the tool malfunctioning or is input wrong?\n3. **ONE retry allowed** - If you think you misunderstood the format, try once more\n4. **STOP after second failure** - Report the problem to user\n\n**NEVER**:\n- Try 3+ variations to \"figure it out\"\n- Explore filesystem to understand tool internals\n- Work around a broken tool\n\n**DO**:\n- Report: \"Tool X is failing with error Y. This appears to be a bug in the tool.\"\n- Ask: \"Should I investigate the tool's code or handle this differently?\"\n- Wait for user guidance\n\n### Example\n\n❌ **WRONG** (Defensive Behavior):\n```\nTool failed with \"Invalid format\"\nLet me try format A... failed\nLet me try format B... failed  \nLet me try format C... failed\nLet me check the directory structure...\n```\n\n✅ **CORRECT** (Fail-Fast):\n```\nTool failed with \"Invalid format\"\nLet me try once more with corrected format... failed\n\nThis appears to be a bug in the tool - it expects YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX \nbut files use YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-hostname-hash format.\n\nShould I investigate the script or would you prefer to handle this differently?\n```\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Instructions updated with tool failure protocol\n- [ ] Agent stops after 2 failures of same tool\n- [ ] Agent reports apparent bugs instead of working around\n- [ ] Optional: Hook detects 3+ sequential failures and blocks\n\n## Categorization\n\n**Pattern**: Defensive Behavior\n**Severity**: Medium (wastes time, frustrates user, masks bugs)\n**Frequency**: Recurring (see #145, #143)\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #145 - Agent ignores explicit instruction, continues defensive coding\n- #143 - Agent violated fail-fast by deleting file\n- Axiom #7: Fail-Fast (no workarounds)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:39:20Z","updated_at":"2025-10-29T00:36:39Z","closed_at":"2025-10-27T03:00:32Z","labels":["good first issue","high-priority","prompts"]}

Expected YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX\n```\n\n**Actual task filename format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-hostname-hash.json`\n**Script expects**: `YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX`\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a task using `task_add.py` (creates file like `20250929-004918-nicwin-7ce2c06b.json`)\n2. Try to archive it: `task_process.py modify 20250929-004918-nicwin-7ce2c06b --archive`\n3. Observe error: \"Invalid task ID format... Expected YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX\"\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Repository**: nicsuzor/writing (but affects all academicOps deployments)\n- **Python**: 3.x\n- **Task files**: Located in `data/tasks/inbox/*.json`, `data/tasks/queue/*.json`\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**File**: `.claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_process.py` line 87\n\n```python\ntask_id_pattern = re.compile(r\"^\\d{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{8}$\")\n```\n\n**Problem**: This regex expects `YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX` (8 hex digits), but actual task IDs generated by `task_add.py` have format:\n- `YYYYMMDD` - Date\n- `HHMMSS` - Time (6 digits, not 8)\n- `hostname` - Machine name\n- `hash` - Random hex string (8 chars)\n\n**Full example**: `20250929-004918-nicwin-7ce2c06b`\n\nThe regex is checking for 8 hex chars immediately after the date, but actual format has TIME next (6 decimal digits), then hostname, then hash.\n\n## Impact\n\n**Severity**: High - `task_process.py modify --archive` is completely non-functional\n\n**Who is affected**: \n- Anyone trying to archive tasks\n- Agents attempting to auto-archive completed tasks\n- Users trying to modify task metadata\n\n**What breaks**:\n- Cannot archive tasks via script\n- Cannot modify priority/due date if ID format check fails first\n- Task management workflow blocked\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\n### Option 1: Match Actual Format (Recommended)\n\n```python\n# Match actual task ID format: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-hostname-hash\ntask_id_pattern = re.compile(r\"^\\d{8}-\\d{6}-\\w+-[0-9a-fA-F]{8}$\")\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Matches reality\n- More precise validation\n- Clear error messages possible\n\n### Option 2: Relax Validation\n\n```python\n# Accept any format, rely on file lookup\ntask_id_pattern = re.compile(r\"^\\d{8}-.+$\")\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n- More flexible\n- Works if format changes\n\n**Drawback**:\n- Less validation\n\n### Option 3: Accept Filename Without Extension\n\nAllow users to pass either:\n- Full filename: `20250929-004918-nicwin-7ce2c06b.json`\n- Filename without extension: `20250929-004918-nicwin-7ce2c06b`\n\n```python\n# Strip .json if present\nif task_id.endswith('.json'):\n    task_id = task_id[:-5]\n\n# Match full task ID format\ntask_id_pattern = re.compile(r\"^\\d{8}-\\d{6}-\\w+-[0-9a-fA-F]{8}$\")\n```\n\n## Additional Investigation Needed\n\n**Question**: Why does regex expect `YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX`?\n\n1. Was there a format change in `task_add.py` that `task_process.py` didn't follow?\n2. Is the regex copied from old code?\n3. Is there documentation defining the \"official\" task ID format?\n\n**Action**: Check `task_add.py` to see what format it generates and ensure both scripts agree.\n\n## Testing\n\nAfter fix, verify:\n\n```bash\n# Create task\nuv run python scripts/task_add.py --title \"Test task\" --priority 1\n\n# Get task ID from output (e.g., 20251024-120000-hostname-abc12345)\n\n# Modify task (should work)\nuv run python scripts/task_process.py modify 20251024-120000-hostname-abc12345 --priority 2\n\n# Archive task (should work)\nuv run python scripts/task_process.py modify 20251024-120000-hostname-abc12345 --archive\n\n# Verify task moved to data/tasks/archived/\nls data/tasks/archived/20251024-120000-hostname-abc12345.json\n```\n\n## Related Files\n\n- `.claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_add.py` - Creates tasks with actual format\n- `.claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_view.py` - Reads tasks (may have correct format)\n- `.claude/skills/task-management/scripts/task_process.py` - **BROKEN** - expects wrong format\n\n## Labels\n\n`bug`, `infrastructure`, `high-priority` - Blocks core task management functionality","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:39:54Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T23:54:04Z","labels":["high-priority","infrastructure"]}

Accomplishments record STRATEGIC progress and decisions.\n\n**Three levels of importance**:\n\n1. **Strategic work** (always document):\n   - Big decisions affecting priorities or direction\n   - Major milestones delivered\n   - Significant collaborations or opportunities\n   - Work directly aligned with top goals\n   - Problems that changed approach\n   - **Detail level**: 2-5 lines explaining context and impact\n\n2. **Routine technical work** (document sparingly):\n   - Infrastructure improvements\n   - Bug fixes and refactoring\n   - Configuration updates\n   - **Detail level**: Merge into one line per project, or omit entirely\n   - **Example**: \"[Project] improved repository automation\" (not \"fixed pre-commit hook to allow JSON with comments\")\n\n3. **Trivial updates** (omit):\n   - Dependency updates\n   - Formatting changes\n   - Minor script edits\n   - **These belong in git log only**\n\n**Decision framework**:\n- Does this relate to user's top 3 strategic goals? → Strategic work\n- Would user mention this in a monthly report? → Strategic work\n- Is this a technical detail they'll forget by next week? → Routine or trivial\n- Did this change the plan or open new opportunities? → Strategic work\n- Is this just making existing things work better? → Routine\n\n**Writing location**:\n- ALWAYS write to `$ACADEMICOPS_PERSONAL/data/context/accomplishments.md` (personal repo: @nicsuzor/writing)\n- NEVER write to project repos (buttermilk/data/, bot/data/, etc.)\n- Personal strategic database is authoritative regardless of which project user is working on\n\n**Detail placement**:\n- Accomplishments.md: Strategic summary only\n- Project data files (`data/projects/*.md`): Technical details if needed\n```\n\nRemove any references to \"morale assessment\" (none found in current version, but ensure none added).\n\n### Anti-Bloat Check\n\n- [x] **Hierarchy Check**: No scripts/hooks/config solution exists\n- [x] **Bloat Estimate**: ~40 lines, ~800 tokens (acceptable for strategic guidance)\n- [x] **Modularity**: Belongs in scribe SKILL.md (specific to this skill's behavior)\n- [x] **DRY Check**: Not duplicating other docs\n- [x] **Complexity Budget**: SKILL.md is ~400 lines, adding 40 stays reasonable\n- [x] **Justification**: Addresses user-reported pattern of overly detailed captures\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Add \"Strategic Capture: Level of Detail\" section to scribe SKILL.md\n2. Verify no \"morale\" references exist\n3. Test with actual sessions\n4. Commit to bot/skills/scribe/SKILL.md\n5.

{"id":"aops-159","title":"Simplify validate_tool.py markdown validation to blacklist instead of whitelist","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrent `_is_allowed_md_path()` function in validate_tool.py uses complex whitelist logic matching the pre-commit hook. This creates maintenance burden and unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Current approach** (lines 403-465):\n- Whitelists: bot/*, papers/*, review/*, projects/*/papers/*, projects/*/manuscripts/*, CLAUDE.md files\n- Complex path normalization and pattern matching\n- 60+ lines of code\n\n**User request**: \"Instead of whitelisting paths just prevent new .md files in '/' project root, cwd or '/docs'.\"\n\n## Root Cause\n\nOver-engineering. The validate_tool.py hook doesn't need to replicate the full pre-commit hook logic. It just needs to catch the most common mistake: creating README.md, HOWTO.md, etc. in the project root or docs directory.\n\n## Solution Design\n\n### Enforcement Hierarchy\n\n**Q1: Can SCRIPTS prevent this?**\nYES - This IS a script (validate_tool.py hook). We're simplifying the script.\n\n**Decision**: Simplify the blacklist logic.\n\n### Proposed Implementation\n\nReplace `_is_allowed_md_path()` (lines 403-465) with simpler blacklist:\n\n```python\ndef _is_allowed_md_path(file_path: str) -\u003e bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if .md file is in an allowed path.\n    \n    BLOCKED locations:\n    - Project root (top-level .md files like README.md, HOWTO.md)\n    - docs/ directory (documentation files)\n    - cwd if different from project root\n    \n    Everything else is allowed (pre-commit hook will catch additional violations).\n    \n    This hook prevents the MOST COMMON mistake: creating docs in project root.\n    The pre-commit hook provides comprehensive validation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not file_path:\n        return False\n    \n    # Convert to Path object\n    path_obj = Path(file_path)\n    \n    # If absolute path, convert to relative path from cwd\n    if path_obj.is_absolute():\n        try:\n            cwd = Path.cwd()\n            path_obj = path_obj.relative_to(cwd)\n        except ValueError:\n            # Path outside cwd - allow (pre-commit will catch if problematic)\n            return True\n    \n    # Convert to POSIX string for pattern matching\n    path = path_obj.as_posix()\n    \n    # BLOCK: Top-level .md files in project root\n    # Example: README.md, HOWTO.md, GUIDE.md\n    if \"/\" not in path:\n        return False\n    \n    # BLOCK: Files in docs/ directory\n    # Example: docs/README.md, docs/API.md\n    if path.startswith(\"docs/\"):\n        return False\n    \n    # Allow everything else\n    # Pre-commit hook will provide comprehensive validation\n    return True\n```\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Simpler: ~30 lines instead of 60+ lines\n- Blacklist approach: Block common mistakes, allow everything else\n- Separation of concerns: validate_tool.py catches real-time mistakes, pre-commit provides comprehensive validation\n- Reduces maintenance: No need to keep hook and pre-commit in sync\n\n### Anti-Bloat Check\n\n- [x] **Hierarchy Check**: This is script simplification\n- [x] **Code reduction**: 60+ lines → ~30 lines\n- [x] **Functionality preserved**: Still catches README.md in root\n- [x] **Better separation**: Hook for real-time, pre-commit for comprehensive\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Replace `_is_allowed_md_path()` in hooks/validate_tool.py\n2. Update docstring to explain blacklist approach\n3. Test with:\n   - Creating README.md in root (should block)\n   - Creating docs/API.md (should block)  \n   - Creating data/CLAUDE.md (should allow - pre-commit will handle)\n   - Creating bot/agents/foo.md (should allow)\n4.

{"id":"aops-160","title":"Create end-of-session subagent for commit/scribe/task workflows","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrent stop hook directly requests scribe invocation, but this is incomplete:\n- Missing commit workflow (changes may be uncommitted)\n- Missing task updates (task progress not captured)\n- Scribe runs without context of what needs committing\n- User has to manually orchestrate commit → scribe → task updates\n\n**Current flow:**\n```\nStop hook → Request scribe → Agent invokes scribe → Done\n```\n\n**Issues:**\n- Uncommitted changes left behind\n- Tasks not updated with progress\n- No integrated end-of-session workflow\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate dedicated end-of-session subagent that orchestrates complete workflow:\n\n```\nStop hook → Request end-of-session subagent → Subagent runs:\n  1. Check for uncommitted changes (git status)\n  2. If changes exist → Invoke git-commit skill\n  3. Invoke scribe skill (capture context)\n  4. Check if tasks were worked on\n  5. If tasks mentioned → Update task notes/progress\n  6. Return control\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Create End-of-Session Agent\n\n**File**: `bot/agents/end-of-session.md`\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Git status check\n- Conditional git-commit skill invocation\n- Scribe skill invocation\n- Task progress updates\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Must NOT trigger SubagentStop hook recursively\n- Should complete quickly (\u003c30s)\n- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)\n\n### 2. Update Stop Hook\n\n**File**: `bot/hooks/request_scribe_stop.py`\n\n**Change:**\n```python\n# BEFORE\n\"reason\": \"If this marks the end of a substantial chunk of work, please invoke the scribe skill...\"\n\n# AFTER  \n\"reason\": \"If this marks the end of a substantial chunk of work, please invoke the end-of-session agent to handle commits, context capture, and task updates. Use: Task(subagent_type='end-of-session', ...)\"\n```\n\n### 3. Configure SubagentStop Hook Exclusion\n\n**Research needed:** How to prevent SubagentStop hook from triggering for specific subagent types?\n\n**Options:**\nA. SubagentStop hook checks `subagent_type` field and allows end-of-session\nB. Different hook configuration for different subagent types\nC. State file pattern (like current scribe hook uses)\n\n### 4. Integration Points\n\n**git-commit skill:**\n- Already exists\n- Validates commits before creating\n- Handles commit message generation\n\n**scribe skill:**\n- Already exists\n- Captures task completion, strategic decisions, non-task work\n- Updates accomplishments.md\n\n**Task management:**\n- Scripts in `~/.claude/skills/scribe/scripts/`\n- `task_process.py modify \u003ctask_id\u003e` for updates\n- Need pattern for \"which tasks were worked on?\"\n\n## Design Questions\n\n### Q1: How does subagent avoid triggering SubagentStop hook?\n\n**Option A**: Hook checks `subagent_type` input field\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    subagent_type = input_data.get(\"subagent_type\")\n    \n    if subagent_type == \"end-of-session\":\n        # Allow without requesting scribe\n        return {\"hookSpecificOutput\": {}}\n```\n\n**Option B**: Use state file (like current implementation)\n- Creates `/tmp/end_of_session_running_{session_id}.flag`\n- SubagentStop hook checks for this file\n- Cleanup on completion\n\n**Recommendation**: Option A (cleaner, more explicit)\n\n### Q2: How does agent know which tasks were worked on?\n\n**Option A**: Agent reviews transcript/accomplishments\n- Read recent accomplishments.md updates\n- Infer tasks from file modifications\n- Requires agent intelligence (not deterministic)\n\n**Option B**: TodoWrite hook captures task associations\n- When TodoWrite used, log task IDs being worked on\n- End-of-session agent reads this log\n- More deterministic\n\n**Option C**: Manual - agent asks user\n- Not acceptable (automation goal)\n\n**Recommendation**: Option A for MVP (agent reviews context)\n\n### Q3: Should git-commit always run or be conditional?\n\n**Conditional on git changes:**\n```python\n# Check for changes\nresult = subprocess.run([\"git\", \"status\", \"--short\"], capture_output=True)\n\nif result.stdout.strip():\n    # Has changes → invoke git-commit skill\n    invoke_skill(\"git-commit\")\n```\n\n**Always run (git-commit skill decides):**\n- git-commit skill already checks for changes\n- Simpler logic in end-of-session agent\n\n**Recommendation**: Conditional check (more explicit, avoids unnecessary skill invocation)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] End-of-session agent created with clear workflow\n- [ ] Stop hook updated to invoke subagent\n- [ ] SubagentStop hook excludes end-of-session subagent\n- [ ] Git changes committed automatically when present\n- [ ] Scribe captures context from session\n- [ ] Task progress updated when applicable\n- [ ] No infinite loops (hook → subagent → hook)\n- [ ] Tested with: changes + no changes, tasks + no tasks\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Research SubagentStop hook input schema (use claude-hooks skill)\n2. Create end-of-session agent instructions\n3. Update request_scribe_stop.py to invoke subagent\n4. Update/create SubagentStop hook to exclude end-of-session\n5. Test workflow combinations\n6. Document in INDEX.md\n\n## Risks\n\n- **Recursive loops**: SubagentStop triggering itself\n- **Performance**: Additional overhead on every stop\n- **User interruption**: Long-running workflows might annoy user\n- **False positives**: Committing when user didn't want to\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Explicit hook exclusion logic\n- Timeout on subagent execution\n- Clear messaging to user about what's happening\n- git-commit skill already validates before committing","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T04:54:48Z","updated_at":"2025-10-29T05:17:24Z","closed_at":"2025-10-29T05:06:24Z","labels":["infrastructure","prompts"]}

No guesses.)\n**Behavioral Pattern**: Documentation without verification\n**Date**: 2025-10-30\n**Repository**: buttermilk\n\n## What Happened\n\nAgent made two sets of changes to CLI documentation without testing:\n\n1. **Earlier commit (441aa909)**: Added CLI validation and improved help messages in `buttermilk/runner/cli.py`\n   - Did not test that `bm` command works\n   - Did not discover missing `buttermilk/conf/__init__.py` file\n   - Code changes broke the CLI entirely but wasn't caught\n\n2. **README update (today)**: Documented third-party CLI usage\n   - Wrote instructions for using `--config-path` flag (incorrect - should be `--config-dir`)\n   - Documented commands without testing them\n   - User discovered issues when attempting to follow the documentation\n\n## What Should Have Happened\n\nPer Axiom #13 (VERIFY FIRST) and Axiom #17 (DON'T MAKE SHIT UP):\n\n**For code changes (commit 441aa909)**:\n1. Make CLI improvements\n2. **Test the `bm` command still works** in buttermilk repo\n3. **Test the `bm` command works** from external project\n4. Verify error messages are actually helpful\n5. Commit only after verification\n\n**For documentation (README update)**:\n1. Read existing CLI code to understand config loading\n2. **Test the documented commands** in both contexts (buttermilk repo and third-party)\n3. Only document features that were verified working\n4. If unsure, ask user or investigate further\n\n## Evidence\n\n**Missing file** (pre-existing bug uncaught by testing):\n```bash\n$ ls buttermilk/conf/__init__.py\nls: cannot access 'buttermilk/conf/__init__.py': No such file or directory\n```\n\n**Error when user tried documented commands**:\n```\n❯ uv run bm --config-dir ../conf run=batch +flow=trans \"flows=[trans]\"\nPrimary config module 'buttermilk.conf' not found.\nCheck that it's correct and contains an __init__.py file\n```\n\n**README documented wrong flag**:\n```markdown\n# Use bm with custom config path\nbm --config-path=./conf run.mode=console run.flow=your_flow\n```\n\nShould have been `--config-dir` not `--config-path`.\n\n**Agent acknowledgement**:\n\u003e \"You're absolutely right to call that out...

Strengthen _CORE.md with explicit testing requirement before documentation\n2. Add to INSTRUCTIONS.md workflow: \"Step N: Test documented commands\"\n3.

Enhance `validate_tool.py` with path-based rules\n2. Add forbidden patterns for bot/data/, .venv/, .env\n3. Test with integration tests\n4. Deploy to all repos\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- All Read/Write/Edit to bot/data/ blocked immediately\n- Clear error messages guide agents to correct paths\n- Tests pass in CI\n\n### Phase 2: Detection (Monitoring)\n1. Create `analyze_violations.py` script\n2. Add CLI and JSON output formats\n3. Test on recent session logs\n4. Document usage\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Can analyze any session transcript\n- Finds all Read/Write/Edit to forbidden paths\n- Reports blocked vs successful violations\n\n### Phase 3: Monitoring (Automation)\n1. Add post-session hook to run analyzer\n2. Create violations database (data/violations.jsonl)\n3. Set up weekly cron job for reports\n4. (Optional) Build Streamlit dashboard\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Violations detected automatically after sessions\n- Weekly reports generated\n- Trends visible over time\n\n### Phase 4: Testing (CI/CD)\n1. Write permission unit tests\n2. Add integration tests with claude_headless\n3. Configure CI to run tests on every commit\n4. Block merges if permission tests fail\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Permission rules tested automatically\n- Regressions caught before merge\n- Enforcement reliability measured\n\n## Why This Solves The Problem\n\n**User requirements:**\n1. ✅ \"Deny most agents, allow specific\" → Universal path rules (no agent detection needed)\n2. ✅ \"Reliably examine log files\" → `analyze_violations.py` script\n3. ✅ \"Monitor compliance\" → Post-session hooks + weekly reports\n4. ✅ \"Test enforcement\" → pytest + CI integration\n\n**Architecture benefits:**\n- **No agent detection required** (avoids #93 fragility)\n- **Path-based rules** (addresses #103)\n- **DRY compliant** (scribe skill keeps path knowledge, hook just enforces patterns)\n- **Fail-fast** (violations blocked immediately)\n- **Observable** (violations detected and reported)\n- **Testable** (CI ensures rules work)\n\n## Related Issues\n- #93: Developer agent cannot write/edit files (agent detection broken)\n- #103: Path-based write permissions (need path validation)\n- #25: Cross-directory permission issues\n- #181: Email workflow implementation (current trigger)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Enforcement effectiveness:**\n- Zero successful writes to bot/data/ (100% block rate)\n- Average time to detect violation: \u003c1s (immediate hook block)\n- False positive rate: \u003c5% (legitimate paths allowed)\n\n**Monitoring coverage:**\n- 100% of sessions analyzed within 24 hours\n- Violations reported within 1 hour of occurrence\n- Weekly compliance rate visible\n\n**Testing reliability:**\n- All permission rules tested in CI\n- Zero regressions in enforcement\n- Test suite execution time: \u003c30s","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-02T05:20:11Z","updated_at":"2025-11-02T05:20:11Z"}

{"id":"aops-179","title":"end-of-session: Agent searches past sessions instead of capturing current work only","description":"## Problem\n\nend-of-session agent invokes scribe skill which then searches through past work and captures too much detail, including operational work that isn't accomplishments.\n\n**User feedback**:\n\u003e \"the end of session agent / skill isn't meant to go looking for stuff that other agents did in OTHER sessions. It's just meant as a reminder to 'save anything important (from what you just did!) that we need to remember next time we're planning.' the stuff it's saving (a) takes too long to go find and isn't relevant; (b) is way too detailed (it's not an 'accomplishment' to send an email to josh)\"\n\n## Evidence\n\n**What's happening**:\n1. Calling agent invokes end-of-session with brief work description\n2. end-of-session invokes scribe skill\n3. Scribe skill has \"continuous capture\" instructions\n4. Scribe searches through session looking for things to capture\n5. Scribe writes operational work to accomplishments.md\n\n**Example bloat**:\n- \"Drafted email reply to Josh\" ← operational, not achievement\n- \"Created task for reviewing Sadia's chapter\" ← operational, not achievement  \n- \"Updated future-planning.md with 2026 Paris note\" ← operational, not achievement\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**end-of-session.md (lines 59-68)**:\n```markdown\n### 2. Context Capture\n\n**Always invoke scribe skill** to capture session context:\n\nSkill(command='scribe')\n\nScribe will:\n- Check if substantial work was done\n- Capture task completion, strategic decisions, or non-task work\n- Update accomplishments.md appropriately\n```\n\n**Problem**: Delegating to scribe with NO constraints on what to capture. Scribe then:\n1. Searches back through conversation\n2. Applies its \"continuous capture\" mindset\n3. Writes operational work instead of achievements\n\n**What should happen**:\n- end-of-session receives work description from calling agent (lines 34-37)\n- Should ONLY capture that specific work if it's substantial\n- Should NOT search for other things\n- Should apply \"standup level\" filter (see Issue #152)\n\n## Architecture Gap\n\n**Current flow**:\n```\nCalling agent → end-of-session (with work description)\n                    ↓\n                scribe skill (searches session, captures everything)\n                    ↓\n                accomplishments.md (bloated with operational work)\n```\n\n**Correct flow**:\n```\nCalling agent → end-of-session (with work description)\n                    ↓\n                Evaluate work description against \"accomplishment\" filter\n                    ↓\n                IF substantial achievement:\n                    Write ONE LINE to accomplishments.md\n                ELSE:\n                    Nothing to capture\n```\n\n## Solution Design\n\n### Option 1: end-of-session captures directly (RECOMMENDED)\n\n**Pros**:\n- Fastest (no scribe invocation overhead)\n- Uses work description from calling agent\n- Applies \"accomplishment\" filter directly\n- One-line entries only\n\n**Cons**:\n- Need to duplicate \"accomplishment\" definition from scribe skill\n\n**Implementation**:\n```markdown\n### 2. Context Capture\n\n**Evaluate work description** received from calling agent:\n\n**IF work qualifies as accomplishment** (see criteria below):\n- Write ONE LINE to `$ACADEMICOPS_PERSONAL/data/context/accomplishments.md`\n- Format: \"Completed [brief description]\"\n- No implementation details, no summaries\n\n**Accomplishment criteria** (\"standup level\"):\n✅ Write if:\n- Task completed from task system\n- Meeting attended and completed\n- Paper/report delivered\n- Code shipped to production\n- Presentation given\n\n❌ Do NOT write if:\n- Email processed\n- Task created (not completed)\n- Planning/discussion only\n- Minor changes\n```\n\n### Option 2: Add constraints to scribe invocation\n\n**Pros**:\n- Reuses scribe skill\n\n**Cons**:\n- Scribe skill still has \"continuous capture\" mindset\n- Slower (invocation overhead)\n- Harder to constrain scribe's search behavior\n\n### Option 3: Create minimal scribe-lite for end-of-session\n\n**Pros**:\n- Dedicated context\n\n**Cons**:\n- Duplication of logic\n- More maintenance\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Option 1**: end-of-session captures directly without invoking scribe.\n\n**Why**: \n- Enforces \"save what you just did\" not \"search for stuff\"\n- Faster (critical for end-of-session hook timeout)\n- Uses context already provided by calling agent\n- Simple \"accomplishment\" filter applied once\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Update end-of-session.md:\n   - Remove scribe skill invocation\n   - Add \"Accomplishment Filter\" section (copy from Issue #152 solution)\n   - Add direct write to accomplishments.md if criteria met\n   - Keep it minimal (\u003c10 lines of logic)\n\n2. Test scenarios:\n   - Operational work (email reply) → NO capture\n   - Task creation → NO capture\n   - Task completion → ONE LINE capture\n   - Code committed → ONE LINE capture (if substantial)\n   - Planning discussion → NO capture\n\n3. Update scribe skill separately (Issue #152):\n   - Still fix scribe's accomplishment definition\n   - But end-of-session won't invoke it anymore\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] end-of-session completes in \u003c5 seconds (not searching past work)\n- [ ] Only writes to accomplishments.md if work was substantial\n- [ ] One-line entries only (\"standup level\")\n- [ ] Uses work description from calling agent (not searching)\n- [ ] No operational work captured (email replies, task creation, planning)\n- [ ] User sees only achievements in accomplishments.md\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #152: task-management: Agent conflates operational work with achievements\n- #184: Stop hook regression: end-of-session agent invocation broken\n\n## Severity\n\n**High**: Performance issue (slow) + data quality issue (bloated accomplishments.md)\n\n## Tags\n\n#bug #prompts #high-priority #performance #data-quality","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-03T03:07:26Z","updated_at":"2025-11-03T03:30:49Z","closed_at":"2025-11-03T03:11:52Z","labels":["bots","high-priority","prompts"]}

Be in buttermilk repository (third-party project)\n2. Invoke supervisor agent via `/dev` command\n3. Agent uses Write tool to create `WEAVE_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` in project root\n4. Hook executes but returns \"allow\" without warning\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Repository**: buttermilk (third-party project at /home/nic/src/buttermilk)\n- **CWD**: /home/nic/src/buttermilk\n- **Agent**: supervisor (invoked via Task tool from main session)\n- **Hook**: PreToolUse → validate_tool.py\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe validation rule exists and appears correct:\n\n```python\nValidationRule(\n    name=\"All code should be self-documenting; no new documentation allowed\",\n    severity=\"warn\",\n    tool_patterns=[\"Write\"],\n    allowed_agents={\"trainer\"},  # ← Potential issue?\n    custom_matcher=lambda tool_name, tool_input: (\n        tool_name == \"Write\"\n        and tool_input.get(\"file_path\", \"\").lower().endswith(\".md\")\n        and not _is_allowed_md_path(tool_input.get(\"file_path\", \"\"))\n    ),\n)\n```\n\nThe `_is_allowed_md_path` logic also appears correct:\n```python\ndef _is_allowed_md_path(file_path: str) -\u003e bool:\n    # ... conversion logic ...\n    path = path_obj.as_posix()  # Should be 'WEAVE_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md'\n    \n    # BLOCK: Top-level .md files in project root\n    if \"/\" not in path:\n        return False  # ← Should block\n```\n\n**Possible causes**:\n\n### Hypothesis A: Agent Name Mismatch\nThe rule has `allowed_agents={\"trainer\"}`. If the supervisor agent is somehow being identified as \"trainer\", the rule wouldn't trigger at all.\n\n**Test**: Check agent name in hook input - does supervisor agent pass a different name?\n\n### Hypothesis B: Silent Exception\nHook execution might be catching and suppressing exceptions, causing the rule to silently fail.\n\n**Test**: Add debug logging to hook execution.\n\n### Hypothesis C: Path Resolution Bug\nThe absolute path `/home/nic/src/buttermilk/WEAVE_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` might not be converting correctly to relative path `WEAVE_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md`.\n\n**Test**: Log the actual path value inside `_is_allowed_md_path`.\n\n## Impact\n\n**Critical for enforcement**:\n- Hook is primary defense against documentation file creation\n- User has explicit instruction in CLAUDE.md forbidding proactive documentation\n- This violation was only caught post-hoc by user inspection\n- Pattern has now occurred twice (issue #153)\n\n**Who is affected**:\n- All agents working in third-party repositories\n- Supervisor agent specifically (most likely to create summary files)\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\n1. **Immediate**: Add debug logging to identify which hypothesis is correct\n2. **Short-term**: Fix identified bug (agent name matching, path resolution, or exception handling)\n3. **Long-term**: Add integration test for this specific scenario\n\n**Debug logging needed**:\n```python\ndef _is_allowed_md_path(file_path: str) -\u003e bool:\n    safe_log_to_debug_file(f\"DEBUG: Checking path: {file_path}\")\n    # ... existing logic ...\n    safe_log_to_debug_file(f\"DEBUG: Normalized path: {path}\")\n    safe_log_to_debug_file(f\"DEBUG: '/' in path: {'/' in path}\")\n    safe_log_to_debug_file(f\"DEBUG: Returning: {result}\")\n    return result\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #153 - Agent creates standalone documentation (this is instance #2)\n- #166 - Simplified markdown validation (this rule was added/simplified)\n- #110 - Fix validation hook test failures\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Identify root cause (agent name, path resolution, or exception)\n- [ ] Fix identified bug\n- [ ] Add integration test reproducing scenario\n- [ ] Verify hook warns on root-level .md file creation\n- [ ] Verify hook allows legitimate .md files (agents/, experiments/)\n- [ ] Test with supervisor agent specifically","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-03T08:52:12Z","updated_at":"2025-11-05T02:33:08Z","labels":["high-priority","infrastructure"]}

Ask clarifying questions about the scope of the documentation update\n2. Help user think through what needs changing and why\n3. **Hand off to appropriate agent** for execution (general-purpose or direct user action)\n4. Return to strategic planning discussion\n\n## Evidence\n\nFrom conversation transcript (lines ~104000-101000):\n\n```\nUser: \"wherever we have info about that looker dashboard, delete it...\"\n\nStrategic Partner: [Immediately executes]\n- Grep for \"lookerstudio|looker studio\"\n- Found 5 files\n- Edit data/projects/automod-demo.md\n- Edit docs/projects/tja.md  \n- Edit docs/projects/automod.md\n- [... 5 file edits total ...]\n- git commit \u0026\u0026 git push\n```\n\nNo facilitation questions asked. No handoff to execution agent. Direct execution.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Why this happened**:\n\n1. **Ambiguous request interpretation**: User's statement \"delete it\" could be interpreted as:\n   - A planning item to discuss (\"we should update the docs\")\n   - A direct execution request (\"do this now\")\n\n2. **Missing handoff trigger**: Strategic-partner has no clear instruction to recognize when it should hand off to another agent vs continue facilitating\n\n3. **Lack of explicit non-execution enforcement**: While SKILL.md states boundaries, there's no active prevention mechanism\n\n## Behavioral Pattern\n\n**Pattern**: **Scope Creep** - Agent exceeded defined role boundaries\n\n**Specific sub-pattern**: **Facilitation → Execution transition** - Agent shifted from facilitation mode to execution mode without explicit handoff\n\n**Related patterns**:\n- Similar to \"Authority Violation\" (wrong agent doing work)\n- Not \"Defensive Behavior\" (agent wasn't avoiding proper behavior)\n- Not traditional \"Scope Creep\" (wasn't adding extra features) - more like \"Role Creep\"\n\n## Enforcement Hierarchy Recommendation\n\nPer trainer.md enforcement hierarchy:\n\n**Q1: Can SCRIPTS prevent this?**\nNo - this is behavioral, not data validation.\n\n**Q2: Can HOOKS enforce this?**\nPartially - Could create PreToolUse hook that blocks certain tools (Edit, Write, Bash with execution intent) when invoked from strategic-partner skill. But hard to distinguish \"read for context\" (allowed) from \"edit for work\" (not allowed).\n\n**Q3: Can CONFIGURATION block this?**\nNo - tool permissions are needed for reading context.\n\n**Q4: Is this instruction-only?**\nYes - This requires **clearer instructions** in strategic-partner SKILL.md:\n\n1. **Add explicit handoff protocol**:\n```markdown\n## When to Hand Off (Not Execute)\n\nIf user requests **substantive work** (not just clarification):\n1. Acknowledge the work item\n2. Suggest appropriate agent for execution\n3. Offer to help plan the work\n4. DO NOT execute the work yourself\n\n**Substantive work includes**:\n- File editing (Edit, Write tools)\n- Code execution (Bash for non-read operations)\n- Git operations (commit, push, branch)\n- Data processing or transformation\n\n**Example**:\nUser: \"Update the docs to remove references to X\"\n\n✅ CORRECT response:\n\"I can help you plan that update. This looks like documentation work - should we hand this to the general-purpose agent to execute? Or would you like to think through what else might need updating first?\"\n\n❌ WRONG response:\n[Executes file edits directly]\n```\n\n2. **Add execution detection prompt**:\nAdd to strategic-partner system prompt: \"If the user asks you to DO work (not just discuss or plan), explicitly offer to hand off to an execution agent. NEVER use Edit, Write, or execution-mode Bash tools.\"\n\n**Recommendation**: **Instructions** with explicit handoff protocol and tool usage boundaries\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Strategic-partner SKILL.md updated with explicit handoff protocol\n- [ ] Clear examples of facilitation vs execution added\n- [ ] Tool usage boundaries documented (what's allowed, what requires handoff)\n- [ ] Test: Strategic-partner correctly hands off when user requests execution\n- [ ] Pattern no longer observed in production use\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #112 - Design adaptive strategic context system for Strategist agent (may inform handoff design)\n- #126 - Agent chaining: Enforce code-review invocation and feedback loops (similar handoff pattern)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T02:39:22Z","updated_at":"2025-12-26T16:56:20Z","closed_at":"2025-12-26T16:56:20Z","labels":["bots","prompts"]}

{"id":"aops-185","title":"Fail-fast violation: load_instructions.py silently ignores missing project _CORE.md","description":"## Fail-Fast Violation\n\n**Script:** `~/.claude/hooks/load_instructions.py`  \n**Violates:** Axiom #7 (Fail-fast philosophy)\n\n### The Problem\n\n**load_instructions.py lines 70-77:**\n```python\n# Personal tier (OPTIONAL)\nif personal_path := os.environ.get(\"ACADEMICOPS_PERSONAL\"):\n    paths[\"personal\"] = Path(personal_path) / \"core\" / filename\nelse:\n    paths[\"personal\"] = None\n\n# Project tier (OPTIONAL)\npaths[\"project\"] = Path.cwd() / \"docs\" / \"bots\" / filename\n```\n\n**Then lines 276-287:**\n```python\n# Load content from each tier\ncontents = {}\nfor tier, path in paths.items():\n    if content := load_tier_content(path):\n        contents[tier] = content\n\n# Framework tier is REQUIRED\nif \"framework\" not in contents:\n    print(f\"ERROR: Framework file not found: {paths['framework']}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# [continues with output even if personal/project missing]\n```\n\n**The violation:** Script treats personal and project tiers as **OPTIONAL** and silently succeeds even when expected files are missing.\n\n### Real-World Impact\n\n**Issue #191:** Writing repo had `docs/bots/INSTRUCTIONS.md` but hook looked for `docs/bots/_CORE.md`.\n\n**What happened:**\n1. Hook searched for `docs/bots/_CORE.md`\n2. File didn't exist\n3. Hook loaded framework + personal only\n4. **Silently succeeded** - no error, no warning to user or agent\n5. Agent worked for entire session without project-specific context\n6. Neither user nor agent knew something was missing\n\n**Result:** Agent appeared to \"not know\" TJA project, caused user frustration, wasted ~2000 tokens on discovery.\n\n### Why This Violates Fail-Fast\n\n**From AXIOMS.md Axiom #7:**\n\u003e \"No defaults. No fallbacks. If something is missing, scripts should HALT.\"\n\n**Current behavior:** Falls back to framework-only instructions when project file missing.\n\n**Should be:** Exit with error explaining what's missing and where it should be.\n\n### Philosophical Question: Are Project Instructions Optional?\n\n**Current design assumes:**\n- Framework tier = REQUIRED (has universal axioms)\n- Personal tier = OPTIONAL (user may not have personal config)\n- Project tier = OPTIONAL (project may not have specific instructions)\n\n**But is this right?**\n\n**Scenario 1: New project with no docs yet**\n- Fresh clone, no docs/bots/ directory yet\n- Reasonable for hook to succeed with framework-only\n\n**Scenario 2: Established project with docs/ structure**\n- Has `docs/bots/` directory\n- Has other docs in `docs/projects/`, `docs/workflows/`, etc.\n- Missing `docs/bots/_CORE.md` likely an ERROR, not intentional\n\n**Scenario 3: Wrong filename (Issue #191)**\n- Has `docs/bots/INSTRUCTIONS.md`\n- Hook looks for `docs/bots/_CORE.md`\n- This is definitely an error that should HALT\n\n### Current Logic Is Ambiguous\n\nThe script can't distinguish between:\n1. **Intentionally empty** - New project, no docs yet (OK to succeed)\n2. **Wrong filename** - File exists with different name (ERROR - should fail)\n3. **Structural inconsistency** - Has docs/ but missing _CORE.md (WARNING at minimum)\n\n**Result:** Fails silently in cases 2 and 3, violating fail-fast.\n\n### Options for Fix\n\n**Option 1: Strict fail-fast (RECOMMENDED)**\n\nMake project tier REQUIRED if `docs/bots/` directory exists:\n\n```python\n# Project tier - REQUIRED if docs/bots/ exists\nproject_dir = Path.cwd() / \"docs\" / \"bots\"\nif project_dir.exists():\n    paths[\"project\"] = project_dir / filename\n    # Will validate later that file exists\nelse:\n    paths[\"project\"] = None  # No docs/bots/ dir = intentionally empty\n```\n\nThen in validation (line 282-287):\n```python\n# Framework tier is REQUIRED\nif \"framework\" not in contents:\n    print(f\"ERROR: Framework file not found: {paths['framework']}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Project tier is REQUIRED if docs/bots/ exists\nif paths[\"project\"] is not None and \"project\" not in contents:\n    print(f\"ERROR: Project docs/bots/ exists but {filename} not found\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"Searched at: {paths['project']}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"Did you mean to create this file, or rename an existing one?\", file=sys.stderr)\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Catches wrong filename errors immediately\n- Distinguishes \"no docs yet\" from \"docs exist but file missing\"\n- True fail-fast behavior\n\n**Cons:**\n- Breaking change - repos with `docs/bots/` but no `_CORE.md` will now fail\n- Requires migration (but that's appropriate - reveals hidden errors)\n\n**Option 2: Warn but don't fail**\n\n```python\nif paths[\"project\"] is not None and \"project\" not in contents:\n    print(f\"WARNING: docs/bots/ exists but {filename} not found\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"Searched at: {paths['project']}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    # Continue anyway\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Non-breaking\n- Alerts user to potential problem\n\n**Cons:**\n- Not true fail-fast\n- Warning might be ignored\n- Doesn't stop incorrect state\n\n**Option 3: Add --strict flag**\n\nMake strict validation opt-in via flag:\n```python\nparser.add_argument(\"--strict\", action=\"store_true\", \n                   help=\"Fail if docs/bots/ exists but _CORE.md missing\")\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Gradual migration path\n- Users can opt into strict validation\n\n**Cons:**\n- More complexity\n- Default behavior still wrong\n- Violates \"no flags for safety\" principle\n\n### Recommendation: Option 1 (Strict Fail-Fast)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Issue #191 proves this is a real problem** - Silent failure caused real confusion\n2. **Fail-fast is a core axiom** - We should enforce it consistently\n3. **Breaking change is acceptable** - Better to reveal hidden errors than hide them\n4. **Migration is simple** - Just create `docs/bots/_CORE.md` or remove empty `docs/bots/` dirs\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Update `load_instructions.py` with Option 1 logic\n2. Create experiment log documenting change\n3. Test with known repos (writing, automod, buttermilk, etc.)\n4. Commit with clear breaking change notice\n5. Document in changelog\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✅ Fails immediately when `docs/bots/` exists but `_CORE.md` missing\n- ✅ Error message explains what's wrong and how to fix\n- ✅ Succeeds normally when no `docs/bots/` directory (new project)\n- ✅ No silent failures like Issue #191\n\n### Related Issues\n\n- #191 - Agent lacks project context (symptom of this fail-fast violation)\n- #143 - Agent violated fail-fast (different context but same principle)\n\n### User's Observation\n\n**User's question that triggered this issue:**\n\u003e \"but it didn't fail fast. why not?\"\n\n**This demonstrates:**\n1. User noticed the silent failure\n2. User expected fail-fast behavior\n3. Current implementation violated user's (correct) expectations\n4. Framework's own principles weren't being followed\n\nNext: Solution Design","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-05T03:01:15Z","updated_at":"2025-12-26T16:56:05Z","closed_at":"2025-12-26T16:56:05Z","labels":["good first issue"]}

One-time migration\n   - Read all 285 JSON files from data/tasks/**/*.json\n   - Convert to markdown format\n   - Write via `mcp__bm__write_note()`\n   - Preserve directory structure (inbox/queue/archived)\n\n2. **`task_create.py`** - Create new tasks\n   ```bash\n   uv run task_create.py --title \"Task name\" --description \"...\" --priority 2\n   ```\n   - Generate markdown with frontmatter\n   - Use `mcp__bm__write_note(folder=\"data/tasks/inbox\")`\n   - Return task ID\n\n3. **`task_modify.py`** - Update tasks\n   ```bash\n   uv run task_modify.py \u003ctask-id\u003e --status queue --priority 1\n   ```\n   - Search by ID or title via `mcp__bm__search_notes()`\n   - Update fields via `mcp__bm__edit_note()`\n   - Support: status, priority, add notes, add actions\n\n4. **`task_search.py`** - Search tasks\n   ```bash\n   uv run task_search.py \"monash conference\" --status inbox --priority 1-3\n   ```\n   - Wrapper around `mcp__bm__search_notes()`\n   - Filter by status, priority, tags, date ranges\n   - Natural language search via BM vector search\n\n5. **`task_view.py`** - Display tasks\n   ```bash\n   uv run task_view.py --status inbox,queue --sort priority\n   ```\n   - Use `mcp__bm__build_context()` for related tasks\n   - Format for terminal display\n   - Support filtering/sorting\n\n6. **`task_archive.py`** - Archive completed\n   ```bash\n   uv run task_archive.py \u003ctask-id\u003e\n   ```\n   - Move via `mcp__bm__move_note()`\n   - Update status in frontmatter\n   - Maintain WikiLink connections\n\n**Integration with Scribe Skill:**\n- Scribe uses new scripts for all task operations\n- Email triage extracts tasks → `task_create.py`\n- Task updates via `task_modify.py`\n- Search for duplicates via `task_search.py`\n\n### Phase 4: AcademicOps Graph Architecture\n\n**Transform framework from monolithic instructions to connected concept graph:**\n\n```\n$ACADEMICOPS/\n├── concepts/               # Atomic concept nodes (NEW)\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── fail-fast.md\n│   │   ├── dry-principle.md\n│   │   ├── no-assumptions.md\n│   │   ├── standard-tools.md\n│   │   └── no-excuses.md\n│   ├── patterns/\n│   │   ├── skill-first.md\n│   │   ├── resources-symlinks.md\n│   │   ├── enforcement-hierarchy.md\n│   │   └── experiment-driven.md\n│   └── workflows/\n│       ├── git-commit.md\n│       ├── agent-optimization.md\n│       ├── task-management.md\n│       └── tdd-workflow.md\n│\n├── skills/                # Thin wrappers (UPDATED)\n│   ├── scribe/\n│   │   ├── SKILL.md (loads [[task-management]])\n│   │   ├── scripts/ (new BM-based)\n│   │   └── resources/ (symlinks)\n│   └── aops-trainer/\n│       ├── SKILL.md (loads [[experiment-driven]])\n│       └── resources/\n│\n├── agents/                # Orchestrators (UPDATED)\n│   ├── dev.md (loads [[development-workflow]])\n│   └── supervisor.md (loads [[tdd-workflow]])\n│\n└── chunks/                # Shared contexts (REFERENCE concepts/)\n    ├── SKILL-PRIMER.md\n    ├── AXIOMS.md (references concepts/core/*.md)\n    └── INFRASTRUCTURE.md\n```\n\n**Concept Node Structure:**\n\nEach concept is an atomic markdown file with:\n- Single responsibility\n- Clear WikiLink connections to related concepts\n- Examples, not exhaustive rules\n- Skills can reference and update\n\n**Example:** `concepts/core/fail-fast.md`\n```markdown\n---\nconcept: fail-fast\ncategory: core-axiom\nrelated:\n  - \"[[no-assumptions]]\"\n  - \"[[standard-tools]]\"\nlast_updated: 2025-11-06\n---\n\n# Fail-Fast Principle\n\n**Core idea**: Abort immediately when assumptions invalid.\n\n## Rules\n\n- No default values\n- No fallback paths\n- Explicit error messages\n- Fail loudly, not silently\n\n## Examples\n\n**Good**: \n```python\nif not config_path.exists():\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Config not found: {config_path}\")\n```\n\n**Bad**:\n```python\nconfig = load_config() or {}  # Silent failure!\n```\n\n## When to Apply\n\n- Configuration loading\n- File path validation\n- API responses\n- User input\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- [[no-assumptions]] - Why we fail fast\n- [[standard-tools]] - Tools must exist or fail\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Skills Rewrite for Context Awareness\n\n**Transform skills from static to dynamic:**\n\n**Before (Static):**\n```markdown\n# scribe SKILL.md\n\nYou are a scribe. You extract tasks from conversations.\n\nFollow these rules:\n1. Task format must be...\n2. Priority levels are...\n[200 lines of static instructions]\n```\n\n**After (Dynamic):**\n```markdown\n---\nloads_concepts:\n  - \"[[task-management]]\"\n  - \"[[email-triage]]\"\n  - \"[[priority-framework]]\"\n---\n\n# scribe SKILL.md\n\n## Framework Context\n\n@resources/SKILL-PRIMER.md\n@resources/AXIOMS.md\n\n## Context Loading\n\nLoad task management concepts:\n```python\nfrom mcp_tools import build_context\ncontext = build_context(\"memory://concepts/workflows/task-management\", \n                       depth=2, \n                       max_related=10)\n```\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\nExtract and manage tasks from:\n- Email conversations ([[email-triage]])\n- User requests\n- Strategic priorities ([[priority-framework]])\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Load context**: Use build_context() for [[task-management]] concepts\n2. **Extract**: Identify tasks per guidelines\n3. **Create**: Use task_create.py with proper metadata\n4. **Link**: Connect to related tasks via WikiLinks\n\n## Learning Loop\n\nWhen encountering unclear scenario:\n1. Document the case\n2. Update relevant concept node via `mcp__bm__edit_note()`\n3. Propagate learning to framework\n\n## Tools\n\n- `task_create.py` - Create new tasks\n- `task_modify.py` - Update task status/fields\n- `task_search.py` - Search for related tasks\n- `task_archive.py` - Archive completed tasks\n\nSee [[task-management]] for detailed workflow.\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Skills stay thin (\u003c100 lines)\n- Concepts evolve independently\n- BM provides context on demand\n- Learning propagates via concept updates\n- Cross-repository knowledge sharing\n\n## Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: BM Infrastructure Setup\n- [ ] Configure BM project for academicOps repo\n- [ ] Create concepts/ directory structure\n- [ ] Define concept node template\n- [ ] Test cross-project referencing with memory:// URLs\n\n### Phase 2: Task Conversion\n- [ ] Design markdown task format (YAML + body)\n- [ ] Implement `task_convert.py` script\n- [ ] Run migration on all 285 JSON tasks\n- [ ] Validate conversion (spot-check 20 tasks)\n- [ ] Test BM search on converted tasks\n\n### Phase 3: Task Management Scripts\n- [ ] Implement `task_create.py` with BM integration\n- [ ] Implement `task_modify.py` with BM edit\n- [ ] Implement `task_search.py` with BM search\n- [ ] Implement `task_view.py` with BM build_context\n- [ ] Implement `task_archive.py` with BM move\n- [ ] Create tests for each script\n- [ ] Update scribe skill to use new scripts\n\n### Phase 4: Concept Graph Extraction\n- [ ] Extract core axioms → concepts/core/*.md\n- [ ] Extract patterns → concepts/patterns/*.md\n- [ ] Extract workflows → concepts/workflows/*.md\n- [ ] Establish WikiLink connections\n- [ ] Update chunks/AXIOMS.md to reference concepts\n\n### Phase 5: Skills Rewrite\n- [ ] Rewrite scribe skill for BM context loading\n- [ ] Rewrite aops-trainer skill\n- [ ] Rewrite strategist skill\n- [ ] Rewrite git-commit skill\n- [ ] Add learning loops (skills update concepts)\n- [ ] Test each rewritten skill\n\n### Phase 6: E2E Testing\n- [ ] Test task creation → search → modification → archive workflow\n- [ ] Test concept loading and updates\n- [ ] Test cross-repo context building\n- [ ] Performance validation (search speed, context load time)\n- [ ] Documentation updates\n\n### Phase 7: Cleanup\n- [ ] Archive old JSON task files (backup, don't delete)\n- [ ] Remove deprecated task scripts\n- [ ] Update all documentation\n- [ ] Create migration guide for other academicOps users\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- ✅ All 285 tasks converted to markdown and searchable via BM\n- ✅ Task CRUD operations work via new scripts\n- ✅ Vector search finds relevant tasks by natural language\n- ✅ Concept graph covers all core axioms and patterns\n- ✅ Skills load concepts dynamically via BM\n- ✅ Skills can update concepts (learning loop works)\n- ✅ Cross-repo context building via memory:// URLs\n- ✅ Scribe skill successfully uses new task system\n- ✅ No backwards compatibility needed (clean break)\n- ✅ System easier to maintain than previous (single source of truth)\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### BM MCP Integration\n\n**Tools Available:**\n- `mcp__bm__write_note()` - Create tasks/concepts\n- `mcp__bm__edit_note()` - Update content (append, prepend, find_replace)\n- `mcp__bm__search_notes()` - Vector search with filters\n- `mcp__bm__move_note()` - Move between directories\n- `mcp__bm__build_context()` - Load related content via memory:// URLs\n- `mcp__bm__list_directory()` - Browse structure\n\n**Limitations:**\n- BM only indexes markdown files semantically\n- JSON visible in directory listings but not in knowledge graph\n- Must design frontmatter carefully for queryability\n\n### Task ID Preservation\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Keep existing IDs: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-hostname-uuid`\n- Use ID as markdown filename: `20251014-digital-law-symposium.md`\n- Store ID in frontmatter for redundancy\n\n### WikiLink Strategy\n\n**Automatic Linking:**\n- Tasks → Related tasks: `[[task-id]]`\n- Tasks → Talks/papers: `[[talks/2025-monash-slides]]`\n- Concepts → Related concepts: `[[fail-fast]]`, `[[no-assumptions]]`\n- Skills → Concepts: `[[task-management]]`, `[[email-triage]]`\n\n**Benefits:**\n- BM treats WikiLinks as graph edges\n- `build_context()` traverses connections\n- Obsidian graph view visualizes relationships\n\n### Learning Loop Implementation\n\n**How Skills Update Concepts:**\n\n1.

{"id":"aops-189","title":"dbt: Complex CTE with LEFT JOIN returns 0 rows despite data existing","description":"## Problem Summary\n\nCreated a dbt model (`mart_age_revenue_availability.sql`) with complex CTEs and LEFT JOIN that runs without syntax errors but consistently returns 0 rows, despite manual queries confirming 1,879 matching films exist in source data.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Project**: mediamarkets (third-party research project)\n- **Database**: BigQuery\n- **dbt**: 1.10.8\n- **Issue**: SQL logic error in complex model\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create dbt model with 4 CTEs: `us_canada_revenue_films` → `revenue_with_quartiles` → `films_with_tmdb` → `film_availability`\n2. Final SELECT does LEFT JOIN between `films_with_tmdb` and `film_availability` \n3. Join condition: `CAST(films.tmdb_id AS STRING) = avail.tmdb_id`\n4. Run `dbt run --select mart_age_revenue_availability`\n5. Model creates successfully but with 0 rows\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nShould return ~1,879 films (verified by manual query with same logic)\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nTable created with 0 rows, even when:\n- Changed from VIEW to TABLE materialization\n- Changed LEFT JOIN to INNER JOIN\n- Removed WHERE clause filter\n- Simplified type casting\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Type mismatch investigation**:\n- `films.tmdb_id`: INTEGER (from `stg_imdb_theatrical_join_tmdb_id`)\n- `avail.tmdb_id`: STRING (from `stg_mediamarkets__observations`, grouped by `obs.tmdb_id`)\n- Join uses: `CAST(films.tmdb_id AS STRING) = avail.tmdb_id`\n\n**Manual verification queries confirm**:\n- 12,158 US/Canada films with revenue\n- 9,509 films after crosswalk join\n- 1,879 films with matching observations\n- Join condition works in isolation\n\n**Simpler version works**:\nCreated `mart_age_revenue_availability_simple.sql` with subset of CTEs (no film_availability CTE) → 9,509 rows successfully\n\n## Root Cause Hypothesis\n\nComplex CTE nesting or type casting in grouped CTE may be causing BigQuery optimizer issue. The `film_availability` CTE aggregates observations:\n\n```sql\nfilm_availability AS (\n  SELECT\n    obs.tmdb_id,  -- STRING type\n    MAX(...) AS ever_available_svod,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT obs.test_date) AS n_test_dates,\n    ...\n  FROM stg_mediamarkets__observations obs\n  WHERE obs.is_error IS NULL\n    AND obs.release_year IS NOT NULL\n    AND obs.test_date IS NOT NULL\n  GROUP BY obs.tmdb_id\n)\n```\n\nWhen joined to films_with_tmdb (INTEGER tmdb_id), despite casting, returns 0 matches.\n\n## Workaround\n\nUse simpler dbt model without complex aggregation CTE, OR perform aggregation in separate preliminary mart.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Blocking**: Analytical pipeline implementation\n- **Scope**: Third-party research project (not academicOps framework)\n- **Time lost**: ~2 hours debugging\n\n## Recommended Action\n\n1. Stop debugging complex SQL - time investment not justified\n2. Use working simple version as base\n3. Add complexity incrementally with validation\n4. Consider splitting into multiple simpler marts\n\n## Related Context\n\n- File: `/home/nic/src/mediamarkets/dbt/models/marts/mart_age_revenue_availability.sql`\n- Working simple version: `mart_age_revenue_availability_simple.sql` (9.5k rows)\n- This is infrastructure blocking research work, not agent framework issue\n\n## Labels\n\ninfrastructure, bug, needs-investigation (third-party project context)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-06T08:47:28Z","updated_at":"2025-11-06T08:47:28Z","labels":["bots","documentation","infrastructure"]}

Remove `@resources/SKILL-PRIMER.md` from skill-creator\n2. Test skill-creator on task requiring AXIOMS knowledge\n3. Measure: Does it correctly reference @resources/AXIOMS.md?\n4.

This is not testing - it's hiding.\n\n### 2. Agent Failed to Recognize Broken Tests\n\nWhen tests \"passed\", agent should have:\n- Noticed tests assert NotImplementedError\n- Recognized validation code is unreachable\n- Reported: \"tests pass but don't test anything real\"\n\nInstead, agent treated passing tests as meaningful.\n\n### 3.

Missing Pre-execution Checks\n- No verification of script executability before running\n- No proactive checking of file permissions\n- Assumes scripts are ready to run\n\n### 2. Poor Understanding of Project Taxonomy\n- Doesn't understand the distinction between impact work (external) and academic profile (internal)\n- Makes assumptions about project purposes without reading their definitions\n- No systematic approach to project classification\n\n### 3. Lack of Context Building\n- Doesn't read goal/project files to understand the taxonomy\n- Doesn't ask clarifying questions when project type is ambiguous\n- Rushes to execute without building proper context\n\n## Solutions Implemented\n\n### 1. Added Script Permission Verification Workflow\nCreating new instruction in docs/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md:\n- Always check script permissions with `ls -la` before first execution\n- If not executable, run `chmod +x` proactively\n- Track which scripts have been verified in session\n\n### 2. Enhanced Project Classification Guidelines\nAdding to docs/AUTO-EXTRACTION.md:\n- Must read project files to understand their purpose before assigning tasks\n- Academic conferences → academic-profile related projects\n- Industry/government/civil society → impact projects\n- When uncertain, show user the available projects and ask for clarification\n\n### 3. Pre-execution Verification Checklist\nAdding to error-quick-reference.md:\n- Before running any script: verify it exists and is executable\n- Before assigning project: verify project exists and matches task type\n- Before classifying: read relevant goal/project files for context\n\n## Files Modified\n- docs/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md - Added script permission verification workflow\n- docs/AUTO-EXTRACTION.md - Enhanced project classification guidelines\n- docs/error-quick-reference.md - Added pre-execution verification checklist\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n1.

{"id":"aops-316","title":"learning: Hydrator invoked inappropriately during ongoing strategic dialogue","description":"## Initial Observation\n\n**Date**: 2026-01-09\n**Category**: learning\n**Proximate Cause**: Hydrator invoked on user's follow-up response in ongoing strategic planning conversation, suggesting unrelated QA workflow\n**Root Cause**: UserPromptSubmit hook always invokes hydrator without distinguishing new requests from conversation continuations\n**Root Cause Category**: Context Failure\n**Responsible Component**: UserPromptSubmit hook\n\n## Evidence\n\n**Context**: User was in ongoing strategic planning dialogue with effectual-planner agent. User provided direct answers to strategic questions posed by the agent.\n\n**Expected behavior**: \n- User's response recognized as conversation continuation\n- Hydrator skipped (or provided minimal/no guidance)\n- Agent continues strategic dialogue flow\n\n**Actual behavior**:\n- Hydrator invoked on follow-up message\n- Suggested detailed QA workflow (qa-proof) \n- Broke conversational flow\n- User feedback: \"this was during a strategic planning conversation. Hydrator should not have invoked. it's a distraction.\"\n\n## Current Hook Behavior\n\nUserPromptSubmit hook instruction says: \"Why always invoke? Hydration is fast...\"\n\nThis assumes every user message is a NEW request requiring classification/routing. But in multi-turn conversations (especially strategic/planning dialogues), re-hydrating each response is disruptive.\n\n## Principles Violated\n\n- User experience: Breaking conversational flow with unrelated suggestions\n- Context awareness: Not recognizing ongoing dialogue vs new request\n\n## Two Possible Root Causes\n\n### 1. Hook Design: No continuation detection\n\nUserPromptSubmit hook lacks logic to distinguish:\n- **New request**: \"Implement feature X\" (needs hydration)\n- **Continuation**: Answering agent's question in ongoing dialogue (skip hydration)\n\n### 2. Hydrator Design: No conversation-aware mode\n\nEven if invoked, hydrator could recognize continuation context and provide lighter guidance (or none).\n\n## Analysis Required\n\nNeed to determine:\n1. Should hook have discretion to skip hydrator for obvious continuations?\n2. Should hydrator have \"conversation mode\" that recognizes ongoing dialogue?\n3. What signals indicate continuation vs new request?\n   - Message length?\n   - Presence of agent question in prior turn?\n   - Active skill/subagent in session?\n   - User message structure (direct answer vs imperative request)?\n\n## Related Patterns\n\nThis may connect to broader issue of \"when to re-classify\" during multi-turn workflows. Similar to how we don't re-invoke framework skill on every file edit during a refactoring session.\n\n## Proposed Investigation\n\n1. Review session transcript to understand exact context\n2. Identify signals that indicate \"this is a continuation\"\n3. Determine minimal intervention point (hook logic vs hydrator logic)\n4.

This allows content to be read directly from a file, bypassing shell argument parsing issues.\n2.  **Instruction Update**: The `bot/agents/base.md` file was updated with a new critical rule (Rule #9) that explicitly forbids the use of complex shell syntax and mandates a \"write-to-file\" pattern.

Detect location (parent vs submodule)\n2. Load docs/projects/INDEX.md\n3. If in submodule: Load docs/projects/{project}.md\n4. Check CROSS_CUTTING_CONCERNS.md for dependencies\n5. HALT if breaking change to infrastructure\n6. On completion: call project_sync.py to update docs\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Create foundational registry and dependency docs\n2.

As agent works, bot monitors for known anti-patterns\n   - Flags violations in real-time: \"⚠️ Agent suggested 'python' instead of 'uv run python'\"\n   - Logs to session data for analysis\n\n4. **A/B Testing Framework** (advanced)\n   - Maintain two versions of instructions\n   - Randomly assign sessions to control vs treatment\n   - Measure differences statistically\n   - Roll out changes only if significant improvement\n\n**Effort**: High (1-2 weeks setup, ongoing maintenance)\n**Value**: Gold standard - real data on what works\n\n### Success Metrics\n- Statistical significance: Can prove doc changes improve behavior (p \u003c 0.05)\n- Predictive accuracy: % of hypotheses in CHANGES.md that validate as expected\n- ROI: Cost of building system vs value of confidence in changes\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Triggers\n\n**Implement Plan B when**:\n- Making \u003e5 doc changes/month\n- Catching regressions manually\n- Want faster iteration without manual testing\n\n**Implement Plan C when**:\n- Have \u003e50 sessions/month\n- Need statistical rigor for decision-making\n- Want to prove effectiveness to stakeholders\n\n---\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #17 -

Manual Docker Verification Instead of E2E Tests  \n**What happened**: After Docker build, agent ran manual `docker run` commands instead of `pytest tests/test_server_runs.py`\n**Expected**: Use existing test infrastructure\n**Gap**: Test-first verification guidance only exists in Interactive Debugging Workflow, not Standard Development Workflow\n\n### 3. No Guidance on Permission Denials\n**What happened**: Agent tried `python`, got permission denied, but error didn't explain to use `uv run python`\n**Root cause**: System configuration issue - permission denial messages need helpful guidance\n**Not fixable in agent instructions** - this requires system-level config changes\n\n### 4. Continued Through Workspace Conflict\n**What happened**: Agent hit workspace conflict (`dbr` uses buttermilk@llmprocessor, `zotmcp` uses buttermilk@dev) but continued making changes\n**Expected**: STOP and ask user when encountering workspace conflicts that could break other projects  \n**Gap**: Scope escalation checkpoint doesn't specifically call out workspace conflicts\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe Standard Development Workflow has gaps:\n\n1. **Step 4 (TEST FIRST)** focuses on writing NEW tests but doesn't say:\n   - Run existing tests FIRST to establish baseline\n   - Check for existing test infrastructure before writing one-offs\n   \n2. **Step 6 (VALIDATE)** says run full test suite but doesn't say:\n   - MUST use pytest/existing tests, not manual commands\n   - Verification commands = code smell\n\n3. **Scope Escalation Checkpoint** doesn't include:\n   - Workspace dependency conflicts = immediate STOP\n   - Cross-project impacts require user approval\n\n## Proposed Fixes\n\n### Fix 1: Enhance TEST (FIRST) step\n```markdown\n4. **TEST (FIRST)**: \n   \n   **Run existing tests FIRST** to establish baseline:\n   ```bash\n   uv run pytest -v  # Understand current state\n   ```\n   \n   Then write failing tests in `tests/` directory that reproduce the bug or define new functionality.\n   \n   **NEVER create standalone validation scripts or use inline python to test.** All tests must be proper `pytest` tests.\n```\n\n### Fix 2: Add verification guidance to VALIDATE step\n```markdown  \n6. **VALIDATE**: Run the full test suite to ensure your changes have not introduced regressions.\n\n   **🛑 ALWAYS USE TESTS FOR VERIFICATION**:\n   - Verification MUST use pytest tests, not ad-hoc commands\n   - ✅ `pytest tests/test_specific_functionality.py`\n   - ❌ Complex bash pipelines with jq/grep/sed\n   - ❌ One-off verification scripts\n   - ❌ Manual Docker commands to recreate test scenarios\n\n   **If you find yourself writing complex verification commands**: You're doing it wrong. STOP and write a proper test instead.\n```\n\n### Fix 3: Add workspace conflict to scope escalation triggers\n```markdown\n**Trigger for escalation check**:\n- About to read more than 2-3 files not directly mentioned by user\n- Investigation expanding to multiple components/systems  \n- What started as \"help with X\" becoming \"understand how Y architecture works\"\n- **Workspace dependency conflicts detected** (different projects using incompatible versions)\n- Changes that could impact other projects in the workspace\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n- `/home/nic/src/writing/bot/agents/developer.md` - Steps 4 and 6, scope escalation\n\n## Related Issues\n- #61 - Test verification anti-pattern (similar fix already applied to Interactive Debugging Workflow)\n- #68 - The specific zotmcp issue that exposed these gaps","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-05T02:37:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-05T03:45:04Z","closed_at":"2025-10-05T02:38:04Z","labels":["prompts"]}

This was based on superficial code reading and guesswork rather than:\n1. Consulting working examples from other flows\n2. Respecting explicit system reminders about user changes  \n3. Understanding the architecture before making changes\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**Systemic pattern**: Agents make configuration changes without verifying their understanding against working examples.\n\nSpecific failures:\n1. Didn't read working flow examples (transllm.yaml, osb.yaml) to see how `host:` is configured\n2. Ignored system reminder explicitly stating user had intentionally modified the config\n3.

Read flows/osb.yaml and flows/trans.yaml  \n2. Confirmed both use top-level host: field (not in observers:)\n3. Verified system reminder shows user intentionally moved host: to top level\n4. Therefore my change follows established pattern\n```\n\n**NEVER**:\n- Modify configs based solely on code reading without consulting examples\n- Reverse recent user changes without explicit user request\n- Guess at configuration structure when working examples exist\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

Active golden path guide\n\n**Problem**: \n- Orphaned file suggests it should be used but isn't\n- Buttermilk file is in `agents/` directory but is a GUIDE not an agent\n\n## Orphaned Files Needing Action\n\nFrom orphan detection, these files are never referenced:\n\n**bot/docs/**:\n1. ❌ CONTEXT-EXTRACTION-ARCHITECTURE.md\n2. ❌ DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md\n3. ❌ DEBUGGING.md\n4. ❌ DEEP-MINING-PATTERNS.md\n5. ❌ DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md\n6. ⚠️ EXPLORATION-BEFORE-IMPLEMENTATION.md (cross-referenced by Buttermilk but not in bot loading path)\n7. ❌ FAIL-FAST-PHILOSOPHY.md\n8. ⚠️ IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md (cross-referenced by Buttermilk but not in bot loading path)\n9. ❌ GOALS.md\n10. ❌ LOGS.md\n11. ❌ TECHSTACK.md\n12. ❌ WORKFLOW-MODE-CRITICAL.md (may duplicate modes.md)\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Phase 1: Rename for Clarity (Immediate)\n\n**DEVELOPMENT files**:\n```\n$OUTER/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md → $OUTER/docs/MODE-DEVELOPMENT.md\nbot/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md → bot/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md (or FRAMEWORK-DEVELOPMENT.md)\nbot/agents/developer.md → (keep as is - clear in context)\n```\n\n**architecture files**:\n```\n$OUTER/docs/architecture.md → $OUTER/docs/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md\nbot/docs/architecture.md → bot/docs/FRAMEWORK-ARCHITECTURE.md\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Makes purpose immediately clear from filename\n\n### Phase 2: Consolidate Duplicates (High Priority)\n\n**EXPLORATION-BEFORE-IMPLEMENTATION.md**:\n- Keep one canonical version in `bot/docs/`\n- Buttermilk references it (already does via `../../bot/docs/`)\n- Delete Buttermilk copy\n- Update any references\n\n**IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md**:\n- Same approach: Keep in `bot/docs/`, delete Buttermilk copy\n- Update Buttermilk INSTRUCTIONS.md to reference `../../bot/docs/IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md`\n\n**Rationale**: Single source of truth, no synchronization needed\n\n### Phase 3: Fix Orphaned Files (Medium Priority)\n\n**Link to loading hierarchy**:\n1. **DEEP-MINING-PATTERNS.md** → Link from `strategist.md` or `AUTO-EXTRACTION.md`\n2. **DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md** → Link from `documenter.md`\n3. **FAIL-FAST-PHILOSOPHY.md** → Link from `INSTRUCTIONS.md` or `error-handling.md`\n4. **DEBUGGING.md** → Link from `developer.md` OR consolidate with Buttermilk version\n5. **EXPLORATION-BEFORE-IMPLEMENTATION.md** → Link from `developer.md` (after Phase 2 consolidation)\n6. **IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md** → Link from `developer.md` (after Phase 2 consolidation)\n\n**Archive if not needed**:\n1. **CONTEXT-EXTRACTION-ARCHITECTURE.md** → If AUTO-EXTRACTION.md is sufficient, archive\n2. **DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md** → Verify if needed, link from architecture.md or archive\n3. **GOALS.md** → If covered in README.md, archive\n4. **LOGS.md** → If logging conventions are stable, archive\n5. **TECHSTACK.md** → If covered in README.md, archive\n6. **WORKFLOW-MODE-CRITICAL.md** → If duplicates modes.md, consolidate or archive\n\n### Phase 4: Fix Confusing Locations (Low Priority)\n\n**Buttermilk debugging.md**:\n```\nprojects/buttermilk/docs/agents/debugging.md \n  → projects/buttermilk/docs/guides/DEBUGGING.md\n```\n\n**Rationale**: It's a GUIDE not an agent definition, shouldn't be in `agents/` directory\n\n## Proposed Naming Convention\n\nGoing forward, establish clear prefixes:\n\n**Modes**: `MODE-{name}.md` (e.g., `MODE-DEVELOPMENT.md`, `MODE-WORKFLOW.md`)\n- Defines how humans/agents interact\n- Located in: `docs/`\n\n**Workflows**: Descriptive names or `WORKFLOW-{name}.md`\n- Process guides for completing tasks\n- Located in: `docs/`, `docs/workflows/`\n\n**Agents**: `{name}.md` (e.g., `developer.md`, `strategist.md`)\n- Agent behavior definitions\n- Located in: `bot/agents/`, `{project}/docs/agents/`\n\n**Guides**: `GUIDE-{topic}.md` or `{topic}.md` in guides/\n- How-to documentation\n- Located in: `docs/guides/`, `{project}/docs/guides/`\n\n**Architecture**: `{scope}-ARCHITECTURE.md`\n- System architecture documents\n- Examples: `SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FRAMEWORK-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md`\n\n**Meta-files**: `{TYPE}-{name}.md` for framework files\n- Examples: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `FRAMEWORK-DEVELOPMENT.md`\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n**Step 1**: Rename files (affects both bot and $OUTER)\n- Update all references in other files\n- Update INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md entries\n- Test loading paths still work\n\n**Step 2**: Consolidate duplicates\n- Compare content to ensure identical\n- Keep canonical version\n- Update references\n- Delete duplicates\n- Update indexes\n\n**Step 3**: Fix orphans\n- Link critical files from parents\n- Archive non-essential files\n- Update indexes\n\n**Step 4**: Update trainer.md with naming convention\n- Add to \"What to Document in Index\" section\n- Provide examples of good naming\n\n**Step 5**: Run orphan checker\n- Verify no new orphans created\n- Confirm all critical files linked\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] No files with identical names serving different purposes\n- [ ] No duplicate content in bot/ and projects/\n- [ ] All orphaned files either linked or archived\n- [ ] Clear naming convention documented in trainer.md\n- [ ] Orphan checker returns clean\n- [ ] Both INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md files updated\n- [ ] All loading paths verified working\n\n## Questions for Discussion\n\n1. **Renaming strategy**: Agree on MODE-DEVELOPMENT.md vs DEVELOPMENT-MODE.md vs modes/development.md?\n2. **Architecture files**: SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE vs USER-ARCHITECTURE vs just keep architecture.md in different contexts?\n3. **Archive location**: Create `bot/archive/` for obsolete files or delete entirely?\n4. **Buttermilk duplicates**: Consolidate into bot/ or keep separate with divergence allowed?\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #73 -

The current instructions tell it to parse priorities but not HOW to assign them.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe strategist instructions (line 72) mention parsing priorities and due dates, but provide no framework for EVALUATING priority based on:\n\n1. **Time-sensitivity vs deadline**: A task due in a week might need action TODAY (e.g., promoting an event happening next week)\n2. **Strategic goal alignment**: Mapping tasks to goals in `data/goals/*.md`\n3. **Dependency chains**: Understanding who is waiting on whom, what blocks what\n4. **Role/responsibility**: Distinguishing between \"student sends draft\" vs \"supervisor must review before meeting\"\n5. **Action windows**: When something MUST be done, not just when it's DUE\n\n## Examples of Current Failure Pattern\n\nWhen processing emails, the strategist assigned:\n- Event promotion (needs immediate action, event in 1 week) → P3\n- PhD supervision coordination (important, not urgent) → P1  \n- Chapter review (meeting THIS AFTERNOON) → P2\n- Review invitation (deadline in 5 days, not P1 urgency) → P1\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a **Prioritization Framework** section to strategist instructions that provides a systematic process:\n\n### Priority Determination Process\n1. **Extract temporal constraints**\n   - Due date (when it must be complete)\n   - Action window (when action is still effective)\n   - Meeting dates (preparation must happen BEFORE)\n   - Event dates (promotion must happen BEFORE, with lead time)\n\n2. **Map to strategic goals**\n   - Check `data/goals/*.md` for alignment\n   - Profile building / Accountability / Academic output / etc.\n   - Higher strategic alignment increases baseline priority\n\n3. **Identify dependencies**\n   - Who is waiting? (Mentee waiting on mentor = higher priority)\n   - What role do I play? (Lead vs support)\n   - What blocks other work?\n\n4. **Calculate urgency**\n   - P1 (today/tomorrow): Action window closing, immediate blocker, meeting prep due\n   - P2 (this week): Important deadline within 7 days, significant strategic value\n   - P3 (within 2 weeks): Lower urgency or strategic alignment\n\n### Examples\n- **Event promotion** (event in 7 days): P1 because action window is NOW (promotion ineffective if done day-of)\n- **Meeting prep** (meeting in 3 hours): P1 because action window is immediate\n- **Review invitation** (respond by Friday): P2 because it's this week but not today\n- **PhD supervision** (important, no immediate deadline): P2-P3 depending on strategic value\n\n## Constraints\n- Keep framework concise (max 30 lines)\n- Make it a PROCESS not a set of RULES\n- Focus on generalizable principles\n- Don't create rigid scoring system (requires judgment)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `bot/agents/strategist.md` (add new section after line 72)\n- `bot/docs/INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md` (update strategist entry)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-07T23:44:10Z","updated_at":"2025-10-07T23:45:48Z","closed_at":"2025-10-07T23:45:36Z","labels":["prompts"]}

{"id":"aops-75","title":"Architecture: Store computational research methodologies","description":"## Context\n\nUser has a generalizable workflow pattern (academicOps - using devOps practices for computational legal studies) that applies across multiple projects (dbr, tox, tja, mediamarkets). This involves:\n- DBT for data modeling and validation\n- Streamlit/Jupyter for analysis and artifacts\n- Consistent data management practices across projects\n\n## Problem\n\nNo clear place to store methodology documentation that:\n1. Has both generic parts (shareable with others) and project-specific parts (personal)\n2. Can be referenced by agents when working on empirical projects\n3. Won't drift out of sync with actual practice\n4. Doesn't overcomplicate the agent system\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### 1. Methodology Documentation (Generic - Shareable)\n\nCreate `bot/docs/methodologies/` directory:\n\n```\nbot/docs/methodologies/\n  - computational-research.md (overview of academicOps approach)\n  - dbt-practices.md (DBT testing, modeling, validation)\n  - data-validation.md (validation principles across tools)\n  - analysis-artifacts.md (Streamlit, Jupyter best practices)\n```\n\nThese are:\n- Generic best practices anyone can use\n- Version controlled with academicOps\n- Referenced by analyst agent when working on empirical projects\n- Examples extracted from real projects (de-identified)\n\n### 2. Project Workflow (Personal - $OUTER)\n\nCreate `docs/workflows/` in user's repo:\n\n```\ndocs/workflows/\n  - empirical-research-workflow.md (personal workflow, references methodologies)\n  - project-setup-template.md (how to start new computational research project)\n```\n\nThese contain:\n- Project-specific preferences and context\n- References to generic methodologies\n- Integration with user's specific goals/projects\n\n### 3. Update Analyst Agent\n\nModify `bot/agents/analyst.md`:\n- Add reference to `docs/methodologies/*.md` for empirical projects\n- Auto-load methodology docs when working with dbt/, Streamlit, Jupyter\n- No new agent needed - analyst already covers this domain\n\n### 4. Addressing Documentation Drift\n\n**Short term:**\n- Manual sync with explicit references from personal to generic docs\n- Generic docs use de-identified examples\n\n**Long term (future enhancement):**\n- Tooling to extract/validate examples from actual project dbt files\n- CI/CD tests that examples still work\n- Living documentation pattern (extract from code comments)\n\n## Decision Criteria\n\n**Don't create new agent if:**\n- Existing agent already covers the domain (analyst does empirical work)\n- It would add unnecessary complexity\n- It's really just methodology documentation, not a persona\n\n**Split generic/personal if:**\n- Generic parts are shareable and valuable to others\n- Personal parts contain project-specific or sensitive context\n- Clear separation improves maintainability\n\n## Example: DBT Testing Best Practices\n\nThis would go in `bot/docs/methodologies/dbt-practices.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# DBT Best Practices\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. Schema Tests (in schema.yml)\nBuilt-in tests for common checks:\n- `not_null`: Column has no nulls\n- `unique`: Column values are unique\n- `relationships`: Foreign key constraints\n- `accepted_values`: Column has only specific values\n\n### 2. Singular Tests (in tests/)\nCustom SQL queries that return failing rows:\n- Return 0 rows = PASS\n- Return \u003e0 rows = FAIL (shows problematic data)\n- Great for complex business logic\n\n### 3. Test Severity\n- `error` (default): Fails the build\n- `warn`: Shows warning but doesn't fail\n\n### 4. When to Use Each\n- Schema tests: Quick column-level checks\n- Singular tests: Complex multi-column logic\n- Dashboards: Human review, visual exploration\n```\n\nUser's personal workflow in `docs/workflows/empirical-research-workflow.md` would reference this and add project-specific details.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n- [ ] Create `bot/docs/methodologies/` directory\n- [ ] Write `dbt-practices.md` with DBT testing info\n- [ ] Create `docs/workflows/` in $OUTER\n- [ ] Write `empirical-research-workflow.md` in $OUTER\n- [ ] Update `bot/agents/analyst.md` to reference methodologies\n- [ ] Update both INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md files\n- [ ] Document shadow/reference relationships\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n**In academicOps (bot/):**\n- `docs/methodologies/dbt-practices.md` (NEW)\n- `docs/methodologies/computational-research.md` (NEW)\n- `agents/analyst.md` (UPDATE - add methodology references)\n- `docs/INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md` (UPDATE)\n\n**In $OUTER (writing/):**\n- `docs/workflows/empirical-research-workflow.md` (NEW)\n- `docs/INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md` (UPDATE)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-08T00:10:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-08T00:17:17Z","closed_at":"2025-10-08T00:16:44Z","labels":["documentation"]}

Ignored interruption signal\n2. Kept trying different approaches (python, uv run, etc.)\n3. Created ad hoc test script despite prohibition\n4. Prioritized completing todo list over respecting boundaries\n\n## User Impact\n\nQuote: \"i wanted the agent to stop, i interrupted it, but it wouldn't let it go. it just kept on trying to create an ad hoc test script, even though we've prohibited it so many times. i don't know what to do anymore.\"\n\nThis represents a critical trust violation where:\n- User's explicit interrupt is ignored\n- Documented prohibitions (no ad hoc test scripts) are violated\n- Agent persists despite clear user signal to stop\n- Pattern repeats despite \"so many times\" being trained\n\n## Root Causes\n\n### 1. Todo List Completion Obsession\nAgent treats todo list as mandatory checklist that must be completed, even when:\n- User interrupts\n- Approach is prohibited\n- User hasn't requested verification\n\n**Evidence**: TodoWrite tool description emphasizes tracking and completing tasks, but lacks guidance about WHEN TO STOP.\n\n### 2. Testing Instruction Ambiguity\nMultiple conflicting signals:\n- developer.md line 113: \"NEVER create standalone validation scripts\" ✅\n- developer.md line 150: \"TEST: Verify the fix works\" (ambiguous - how?)\n- Issue #61 identifies this exact pattern but fix not implemented\n\n### 3. No Interruption Handling Protocol\nNo instructions exist for:\n- Recognizing when user has interrupted\n- Stopping current task immediately\n- NOT trying alternative approaches\n- Asking instead of persisting\n\n### 4. Verification Pressure Without Method\nAgent feels obligated to verify changes but has no approved method:\n- Prohibited: Ad hoc scripts\n- Prohibited: python -c commands\n- Required: pytest tests\n- Missing: Guidance for \"no tests exist yet\"\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Solution 1: Explicit Stop Protocol (CRITICAL)\nAdd to INSTRUCTIONS.md and all agent prompts:\n\n```markdown\n## 🛑 INTERRUPTION PROTOCOL\n\nWhen user interrupts you or signals frustration:\n1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not try alternatives\n2. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: \"Stopped. What would you like me to do instead?\"\n3. **WAIT** - Do not continue current task\n4. **DO NOT** try different approaches to complete the same goal\n\n**Signs user wants you to stop**:\n- Explicit: \"stop\", \"wait\", \"hold on\"\n- Implicit: Interrupting mid-task, asking questions\n- Frustration: \"why are you...\", \"I said not to...\"\n```\n\n### Solution 2: Testing Verification Clarity\nUpdate developer.md Interactive Debugging Workflow:\n\n```markdown\n3. **TEST (ONLY IF REQUESTED)**:\n   \n   **CRITICAL**: Do NOT automatically test unless user explicitly requests it.\n   \n   If user asks for testing:\n   1. Check if pytest tests exist\n   2. If tests exist: Run them (`pytest tests/test_X.py`)\n   3. If no tests exist: Ask user: \"No tests exist for this. Should I write a pytest test, or would you prefer to test manually?\"\n   \n   **PROHIBITED**:\n   - ❌ Creating ad hoc test scripts (test.py, verify.py, etc.)\n   - ❌ Running `python -c` commands for verification\n   - ❌ Testing without explicit user request\n   - ❌ Trying multiple verification approaches when one fails\n```\n\n### Solution 3: Todo List Flexibility\nUpdate TodoWrite tool description to include stopping conditions:\n\n```markdown\n## When to STOP Todo List\n\nYou should STOP working on todo list immediately when:\n1. User interrupts or asks questions\n2. User signals frustration (\"stop\", \"wait\", \"why are you...\")\n3. Current approach is failing repeatedly\n4. You realize approach violates documented prohibitions\n5. User hasn't explicitly requested the current step\n\n**Mark task as 'pending' and WAIT for user guidance.**\n```\n\n### Solution 4: No-Test-Exists Guidance\nAdd explicit instruction for when tests don't exist:\n\n```markdown\n## When No Tests Exist\n\nIf user hasn't requested testing AND no tests exist for the functionality:\n1. **STOP** after making code changes\n2. **REPORT**: \"Changes complete. No tests exist for this functionality.\"\n3. **ASK**: \"Would you like me to write tests, or would you prefer to verify manually?\"\n4. **WAIT** for user decision\n\n**DO NOT**:\n- Assume user wants testing\n- Create ad hoc verification scripts\n- Try to verify without proper tests\n```\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **CRITICAL - Interruption Protocol**: Add to INSTRUCTIONS.md immediately\n2. **HIGH - Testing Clarity**: Update developer.md per Solution 2\n3. **HIGH - Todo List Flexibility**: Update TodoWrite description\n4. **MEDIUM - No-Test Guidance**: Add to developer.md\n\n## Related Issues\n- #61 - Verification anti-pattern (already documented, needs implementation)\n- #82 - Python execution policy enforcement\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAgent should:\n- Stop immediately when user interrupts\n- Never create ad hoc test scripts\n- Ask before testing when tests don't exist\n- Prioritize user signals over todo list completion\n\n## Files to Update\n1. /writing/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md - Add interruption protocol\n2. /writing/bot/agents/developer.md - Update testing workflow\n3.

{"id":"aops-85","title":"Critical: Localized Fix Without Impact Analysis - Interface Mismatch Failure Pattern","description":"## Executive Summary\n\n**Critical failure pattern identified**: Developer agent makes localized fixes to match error messages without verifying impact across codebase, leading to cascading breakage.\n\n**Root cause**: Missing checkpoint for interface/parameter naming mismatches that requires codebase-wide verification before making changes.\n\n**Solution**: Add \"INTERFACE MISMATCH CHECKPOINT\" to developer debugging workflow requiring grep-based occurrence counting to determine correct naming convention.\n\n**Status**: Issue created, solution designed, awaiting implementation.\n\n## Problem Pattern\n\nWhen encountering parameter/interface naming mismatches, the developer agent:\n\n1. ✅ Sees error message (e.g., \"missing required argument: pipeline_stage\")\n2. ❌ **ASSUMES** error message represents correct naming\n3. ❌ Makes **localized change** to match error without verification\n4. ❌ Creates **cascading breakage** across codebase\n\n## Real-World Example (Zotero Pipeline Bug)\n\n### What Happened:\n- Pipeline called: `processor.process(record, processor_stage=...)`\n- Error received: `missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'pipeline_stage'`\n- Agent's response: Changed call from `processor_stage` to `pipeline_stage`\n\n### The Problem:\n- **Did NOT search codebase** for naming convention\n- **Would have broken**: 38 other references across 9 files\n- **Actual root cause**: Protocol definition was wrong (minority variant)\n\n### What SHOULD Have Happened:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Search both variants\ngrep -r \"processor_stage\" . --include=\"*.py\" | wc -l\n# Result: 38 occurrences (9 files) ✅ CORRECT\n\ngrep -r \"pipeline_stage\" . --include=\"*.py\" | wc -l\n# Result: 6 occurrences (3 files) ❌ WRONG\n\n# 2. Identify root cause\n# Protocol definition used WRONG name (pipeline_stage)\n# Should match codebase convention (processor_stage)\n\n# 3. Fix systematically\n# Update protocol + 6 wrong references\n# NOT the 38 correct call sites\n```\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Layer 1: Missing Verification Step\n- Agent trusts error messages without verification\n- No checkpoint for \"interface mismatch\" scenarios\n- Lacks \"search-before-change\" habit for naming conflicts\n\n### Layer 2: Localized Thinking\n- Focuses on immediate error location\n- Doesn't consider broader codebase impact\n- Missing \"majority wins\" principle for conventions\n\n### Layer 3: Error Message Bias\n- Assumes error messages are authoritative\n- Doesn't question whether error itself might be wrong\n- Protocol/interface definition errors not considered\n\n## Solution Design\n\n### Multi-Layer Prevention Strategy\n\n#### 1. New Checkpoint: INTERFACE MISMATCH\nAdd to developer.md debugging workflow:\n\n```markdown\n## 🛑 INTERFACE MISMATCH CHECKPOINT\n\n**BEFORE changing any parameter name, function signature, or interface to match an error:**\n\n1. **SEARCH BOTH VARIANTS**:\n   ```bash\n   # Count occurrences of each variant\n   grep -r \"variant_a\" . --include=\"*.py\" | wc -l\n   grep -r \"variant_b\" . --include=\"*.py\" | wc -l\n   ```\n\n2. **DETERMINE CORRECT CONVENTION**:\n   - Majority variant (\u003e80%) = CORRECT convention\n   - Minority variant = WRONG (fix these)\n   - Equal split = ASK USER for decision\n\n3. **FIX AT THE ROOT**:\n   - ✅ Fix protocol/interface definitions (minority)\n   - ✅ Fix minority call sites\n   - ❌ NEVER change majority to match error\n\n4. **EXAMPLES OF INTERFACE MISMATCHES**:\n   - Parameter name differences (processor_stage vs pipeline_stage)\n   - Method signature changes (process() vs execute())\n   - Protocol definition errors\n   - API contract violations\n\n**REMEMBER**: Error messages can be WRONG. The codebase majority wins.\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Debugging Methodology\nAdd to \"MANDATORY DEBUGGING STEPS\" section:\n\n```markdown\n6. **VERIFY NAMING CONVENTIONS**: When encountering interface/parameter mismatches:\n   - Use Grep to count occurrences of all variants\n   - Majority variant (\u003e5:1 ratio) is the correct convention\n   - Fix minority variant, not majority\n   - Never trust error messages over codebase evidence\n```\n\n#### 3. Add to Critical Failure Modes\n\n```markdown\n### 6. LOCALIZED FIX WITHOUT IMPACT ANALYSIS\n- **Symptom**: Changing code to match error messages without verifying codebase-wide impact\n- **Prevention**: \n  - Run INTERFACE MISMATCH CHECKPOINT for all naming conflicts\n  - Use grep with count to determine majority convention\n  - Fix at root (protocol/interface definition) not call sites\n  - Trust codebase evidence over error messages\n- **Example**: Changing `processor_stage` to `pipeline_stage` would break 38 references\n```\n\n## Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Documentation Updates (Immediate)\n- [ ] Add INTERFACE MISMATCH CHECKPOINT to developer.md\n- [ ] Update MANDATORY DEBUGGING STEPS section\n- [ ] Add new critical failure mode #6\n- [ ] Update INSTRUCTION-INDEX.md\n\n### Phase 2: Testing \u0026 Validation (Week 1)\n- [ ] Create test scenarios with intentional interface mismatches\n- [ ] Verify agent follows checkpoint before making changes\n- [ ] Document checkpoint effectiveness\n\n### Phase 3: Enforcement (Week 2)\n- [ ] Consider pre-commit hook to detect interface changes\n- [ ] Add linting rule for parameter naming consistency\n- [ ] Create detection script for naming convention violations\n\n## External Research\n\n### Tools for Interface Verification\n\n**1. ripgrep (rg)** - Already in use ✅\n- Fast, supports counting with `wc -l` pipe\n- Can filter by file type: `--type py`\n- Shows context: `-C 2` for surrounding lines\n\n**2. ast-grep** - Consider for future\n- AST-aware searching (understands Python syntax)\n- Can find parameter names in function definitions\n- More precise than text-based grep\n- URL: https://ast-grep.github.io/\n\n**3. Semgrep** - Advanced option\n- Pattern-based code analysis\n- Can detect interface mismatches automatically\n- Steeper learning curve\n- URL: https://semgrep.dev/\n\n**Recommendation**: Stick with ripgrep (current tool). It's sufficient for this checkpoint and already available.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #61 - Agent verification anti-pattern (similar over-complication)\n- #60 - Developer agent workflow fixes\n- #54 - Lazy debugging instead of systematic investigation\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1.

The `max_item_version` tracked across items does NOT represent the library version needed for the next sync.\n\n## Evidence\n\nLog analysis shows `max_item_version` starts at 51061 and remains constant across thousands of records:\n\n```\n{\"fetched_count\": 0, \"max_item_version\": 51061, \"page_num\": 1, ...}\n{\"fetched_count\": 100, \"max_item_version\": 51061, \"page_num\": 2, ...}\n{\"fetched_count\": 200, \"max_item_version\": 51061, \"page_num\": 3, ...}\n...\n{\"fetched_count\": 8300, \"max_item_version\": 51061, \"page_num\": 84, ...}\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**Current (incorrect) implementation** in `buttermilk/libs/zotero.py:176,251,271`:\n- Tracks `max_item_version = max(max_item_version, item.get(\"version\", 0))`  \n- Uses this as `since` parameter for next sync\n- Assumes item versions represent sync progress\n\n**Why this fails**:\n- Individual item versions reflect the LIBRARY's global version counter\n- Items sorted by `dateModified` (ascending) come with \"random\" version numbers\n- The first recently-modified item sets `max_item_version` to library's current version (~51061)\n- Version then stays constant because all recent items have similar versions\n\n## Correct Approach (per Zotero API docs)\n\nThe Zotero API uses **library versions**, not item versions, for sync:\n\n1. Use `zot.last_modified_version()` to get the **library's** current version\n2. Save this library version after successful sync  \n3. Use saved library version as `since` parameter for next sync\n\n**References**:\n- [Zotero Web API v3 Syncing](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/syncing)\n- [Pyzotero last_modified_version() docs](https://pyzotero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## Fix Required\n\nReplace item version tracking with library version tracking:\n\n```python\n# After fetching all items successfully:\nlibrary_version = self.zot.last_modified_version()\nself._save_sync_state(library_version, timestamp)\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- Incremental sync currently doesn't work - every sync is a full sync\n- Wastes API quota and processing time\n- No early termination when library hasn't changed\n\n## Files Affected\n\n- `projects/buttermilk/buttermilk/libs/zotero.py` (lines 176, 251, 271)\n- `projects/buttermilk/buttermilk/libs/zotero.py` (sync state logic)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-10T03:58:30Z","updated_at":"2025-10-10T06:35:56Z","closed_at":"2025-10-10T06:35:55Z"}

When it fails to find these patterns, it returns `\"unknown\"` as the active agent.\n\n**Why It Fails**:\n- The regex pattern `@agent-(\\w+)` only matches exact `@agent-` prefix format\n- If users invoke agents differently (e.g., \"switch to developer agent\", \"use trainer\"), detection fails  \n- Returns `\"unknown\"` when no match found, which gets blocked by the trainer-only write rule\n\n**Impact**:\nWhen `active_agent = \"unknown\"`:\n- Line 85: `if active_agent != \"trainer\"` evaluates to True\n- Developer agent (and all others) get blocked from Write/Edit tools\n- Only explicit `@agent-trainer` invocations work\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Updated Fix Approach\n\n**Phase 1 (Critical)**: Fix the subagent detection mechanism in `get_active_agent()`\n- Support multiple invocation patterns beyond `@agent-{name}`\n- Add fallback detection methods (environment vars, conversation context)\n- Log detection failures for debugging\n- Ensure reliable agent identification\n\n**Phase 2 (Path-Based Permissions)**: Once detection works reliably, implement path-based write permissions:\n\n```python\n# Agent write permissions by path\nAGENT_WRITE_PERMISSIONS = {\n    \"trainer\": [\n        \"bot/agents/\",\n        \"bot/docs/\", \n        \"docs/\",\n    ],\n    \"developer\": [\n        \"bot/\",\n        \"projects/\",\n        \"scripts/\",\n        \"pyproject.toml\",\n        \"pytest.ini\",\n        \"*.py\",  # Test files, etc.\n    ],\n    \"documenter\": [\n        \"docs/\",\n        \"projects/*/README.md\",\n    ],\n}\n\ndef validate_write_permission(agent: str, file_path: str) -\u003e bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if agent can write to this path.\"\"\"\n    allowed_paths = AGENT_WRITE_PERMISSIONS.get(agent, [])\n    # Match file_path against allowed patterns\n    # Return True if allowed, False otherwise\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Preserves safety (agents can't write outside their domain)\n- Enables developer agent to function properly\n- Makes permissions explicit and auditable\n\n## Related Issues\n- #84 - Agent Instruction Binding (this is a specific instance of enforcement failure)\n- #87 - Venv file modification prevention (path-based restrictions example)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Agent detection correctly identifies active agent in all invocation patterns\n- [ ] Developer agent can write/edit files in allowed paths\n- [ ] Developer agent blocked from modifying agent instructions (trainer's domain)\n- [ ] Permission system is explicit and auditable\n- [ ] Detection failures are logged for debugging","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-11T00:49:20Z","updated_at":"2025-10-16T08:22:50Z","labels":["infrastructure","prompts"]}

{"id":"aops-91","title":"Change .md file prohibition from hard block to force-ask","description":"## Summary\n\nChanged the markdown file creation prohibition from a hard block (deny all agents) to a force-ask mechanism that prompts the user for confirmation before allowing the operation.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe previous implementation used `allowed_agents=set()` with `severity=\"block\"` which created a hard prohibition that prevented ALL agents from creating .md files without any opportunity for user override. This was too restrictive for legitimate use cases where .md file creation might be appropriate with user approval.\n\n## Solution Design\n\nImplemented a three-tiered severity system in the validation framework:\n\n1. **\"block\"**: Hard deny - agent is blocked and must switch agents or ask user to perform manually\n2. **\"warn\"**: Soft warning - agent sees warning but operation proceeds\n3. **\"force-ask\"**: User confirmation required - Claude Code UI prompts user to approve/deny the operation\n\nThe force-ask mechanism:\n- Returns `permissionDecision: \"ask\"` to Claude Code\n- Displays confirmation prompt to user in the UI\n- Provides context about what file is being created\n- User can approve or deny the operation\n\n## Implementation\n\nModified files:\n- `/home/nic/src/writing/bot/scripts/validate_tool.py`\n\nChanges made:\n1. Added \"force-ask\" as a third severity level in ValidationRule docstring\n2. Updated check() method to handle force-ask severity with appropriate messaging\n3. Modified main() to map force-ask severity to \"ask\" permissionDecision\n4. Changed .md prohibition rule to use force-ask severity\n5. Reordered validation rules so specific rules (protected files) are checked before general rules (.md files)\n\n## Validation Rule Behavior\n\nThe layered validation now works as follows:\n\n**For protected .md files (e.g., bot/agents/test.md):**\n- Non-trainer agents: Blocked by protected file rule (never see .md prompt)\n- Trainer agent: Passes protected file check, then gets .md confirmation prompt\n\n**For non-protected .md files (e.g., /home/nic/test.md):**\n- All agents: Get confirmation prompt before creating file\n\n**For non-.md files:**\n- No prompts unless they match other validation rules\n\n## User Experience\n\nWhen an agent attempts to create a .md file, the user sees:\n\n```\n❓ CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: Creating new markdown files requires user confirmation\n   Context: file: /home/nic/test.md\n\n   This operation requires explicit user confirmation.\n```\n\nThe user can then approve or deny the operation in the Claude Code UI.\n\n## Testing Performed\n\nTested multiple scenarios:\n1. ✅ Non-.md files: Allowed without prompt\n2. ✅ Regular .md files: Force-ask prompt displayed\n3. ✅ Protected .md files (non-trainer): Blocked by protected file rule\n4. ✅ Protected .md files (trainer): Force-ask prompt displayed\n5. ✅ Python syntax validation: Passes\n\n## Related Context\n\nThis change aligns with the principle of giving users control over potentially disruptive operations while still providing helpful guardrails. The force-ask mechanism provides a middle ground between \"always allow\" and \"always block\".","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-13T04:38:52Z","updated_at":"2025-10-15T02:09:30Z","closed_at":"2025-10-15T02:09:30Z","labels":["prompts"]}

This works well for planning conversations but creates friction when working with other agents.\n\n## Question\n\nShould ALL agents have basic silent documentation capabilities, or should this remain strategist-specific?\n\n## Arguments For Global Adoption\n\n1. **Consistent UX**: Users shouldn't have to switch agents to capture context\n2. **Opportunistic Capture**: Developer working on code might mention future tasks - why not capture them?\n3. **ADHD-Optimized**: Zero-friction capture reduces cognitive load regardless of task type\n4. **Natural Flow**: Users shouldn't have to think \"I need to tell strategist this later\"\n\n## Arguments Against\n\n1. **Role Confusion**: Other agents have primary jobs (coding, reviewing, etc.) - capture could distract\n2. **Performance**: Context extraction adds overhead to every response\n3. **Specialized Skill**: Strategist is specifically good at extraction - generalizing might reduce quality\n4. **Complexity**: More agents writing to data/ increases conflict/coordination needs\n\n## Proposed Approach\n\n**Option 1: Universal Basic Capture**\n- All agents get lightweight extraction instructions\n- Focus on obvious signals (tasks mentioned in future tense, stakeholder names, deadlines)\n- Don't try to match strategist's deep mining\n\n**Option 2: Hybrid Model**\n- Keep strategist as primary extractor\n- Other agents only capture in specific, high-signal cases\n- Example: Developer mentions \"need to document this API\" → creates task automatically\n\n**Option 3: Explicit Handoff**\n- Other agents don't extract\n- They can suggest \"Would you like me to capture this for later?\" when detecting actionable info\n- User says yes → agent creates task/note\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nIf implemented, success means:\n- [ ] Users mention context less frequently in follow-up conversations\n- [ ] No increase in wrong/noisy extractions\n- [ ] Other agents don't get distracted from primary work\n- [ ] Context capture happens without user prompting\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

Agent Detection Fragility\n- Line 415: `active_agent = tool_input.get('subagent_type', 'unknown')`\n- Doesn't work for code-review agent or when agents invoked differently\n- Causes false blocks (#84, #93)\n\n### 2. Overly Broad Pattern Matching\n- Git rule (line 241): Matches 'git' + word anywhere in command\n- Blocks `gh issue comment` because it contains string (see #84 comment)\n- Needs word boundary or more precise regex patterns\n\n### 3. Debug Output Management\n- Line 472: Appends to /tmp/claude-tool-input.json indefinitely\n- File grows without bounds\n- No log rotation or cleanup\n\n### 4. Rule Complexity Mixed with Declarations\n- Some rules use simple patterns (tool_patterns, file_patterns)\n- Others use complex custom_matcher lambdas\n- Hard to understand which approach to use when\n- _requires_uv_run and _is_allowed_md_path helpers are good but inconsistently applied\n\n### 5. No Test Coverage\n- Validation logic has no automated tests\n- Changes risk breaking existing rules\n- Hard to verify fixes work correctly\n\n## Refactoring Goals\n\n### Short-term (This Week)\n1. **Fix agent detection** - Make code-review agent work\n2. **Fix git pattern matching** - Use word boundaries\n3. **Implement debug log rotation** - Cap at 100 entries, rotate to .old\n\n### Medium-term (Next Week)\n1. **Extract all complex matchers to named functions** - No more inline lambdas\n2. **Standardize pattern syntax** - Document when to use tool_patterns vs custom_matcher\n3. **Add validation rule tests** - pytest suite for each rule\n4. **Improve error messages** - Include examples of correct syntax\n\n### Long-term (This Month)\n1. **Configuration-driven rules** - Rules defined in YAML/JSON, not code\n2. **Rule priority system** - Explicit ordering with conflicts detection\n3. **Audit logging** - Track all blocks/warnings/allows to file for analysis\n4. **Performance optimization** - Cache compiled regexes, profile slow rules\n\n## Proposed Structure\n\n```python\n# validate_tool.py\n\n# 1.

Test manually with code-review agent\n\n**Phase 2 (This Week)**:\n1. Extract one complex matcher per day to named function\n2. Add one test file per day for existing rules\n3. Run tests after each extraction to verify no regressions\n\n**Phase 3 (Next Week)**:\n1. Standardize remaining rules to use named functions\n2. Document pattern selection guidelines\n3.

The \"NO DEFAULTS\" rule exists but developer used standard Python `.get()` pattern from muscle memory.\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Why Instructions Failed\n\n1. **Cultural Python Pattern**: `.get(key, default)` is idiomatic Python—developers use it unconsciously\n2. **No Pattern Recognition**: Developer didn't connect general \"no defaults\" rule to specific `.get()` method calls\n3. **Instructions Too Abstract**: Rule says \"no defaults\" but doesn't explicitly call out anti-patterns like `.get()`\n4. **No Technical Enforcement**: Nothing blocks this at code time, only documentation\n5. **Delayed Failure**: Code runs fine, corruption discovered months later\n\n### Comparison to Issue #87\nBoth failures share the same root cause: **Enforcement Hierarchy violation**. We're trying to enforce critical safety rules with the weakest layer (instructions) when we should use technical enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## Multi-Layer Prevention Strategy\n\nFollowing Issue #87's framework: Scripts \u003e Hooks \u003e Configuration \u003e Instructions\n\n### Layer 1: Pydantic Validation (IMMEDIATE - Best Practice)\n\n**For ALL new configuration code:**\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass HostConfig(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Host agent configuration with REQUIRED parameters.\"\"\"\n    max_wait_time: int = Field(description=\"Max seconds to wait for agent responses\")\n    max_user_confirmation_time: int = Field(description=\"Max seconds to wait for user input\")\n    error_threshold: float = Field(description=\"Fraction of tasks that can fail before stopping\")\n    human_in_loop: bool = Field(description=\"Whether to request user confirmation\")\n    \n    # NO defaults - Pydantic raises ValidationError if missing\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Immediate failure on misconfiguration\n- Clear error messages showing what's missing\n- Type validation built-in\n- Self-documenting via Field descriptions\n- Already used in buttermilk for some config\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Only works for new code\n- Requires refactoring existing `.get()` patterns\n- Doesn't catch issues in legacy code\n\n### Layer 2: Custom AST Pre-Commit Hook (STRUCTURED)\n\n**Script:** `bot/scripts/check_config_defaults.py`\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Detect .get() calls with defaults on configuration objects.\"\"\"\nimport ast\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nclass ConfigDefaultFinder(ast.NodeVisitor):\n    \"\"\"Find .get() calls with default values on config-like objects.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.violations = []\n        # Object names that represent configuration\n        self.config_objects = {\n            'kwargs', 'parameters', 'config', 'settings', \n            'params', 'options', 'self.parameters'\n        }\n    \n    def visit_Call(self, node):\n        if isinstance(node.func, ast.Attribute) and node.func.attr == 'get':\n            # Check if called on a config-like object\n            obj_name = ast.unparse(node.func.value)\n            \n            if any(config in obj_name for config in self.config_objects):\n                # Check if it has a default (2nd positional arg or 'default' kwarg)\n                if len(node.args) \u003e= 2 or any(kw.arg == 'default' for kw in node.keywords):\n                    default_val = ast.unparse(node.args[1]) if len(node.args) \u003e= 2 else \"keyword arg\"\n                    self.violations.append({\n                        'line': node.lineno,\n                        'object': obj_name,\n                        'key': ast.unparse(node.args[0]) if node.args else \"unknown\",\n                        'default': default_val,\n                        'call': ast.unparse(node)\n                    })\n        \n        self.generic_visit(node)\n\ndef check_file(filepath):\n    \"\"\"Check a Python file for configuration default violations.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(filepath) as f:\n            tree = ast.parse(f.read(), filename=str(filepath))\n        \n        finder = ConfigDefaultFinder()\n        finder.visit(tree)\n        \n        if finder.violations:\n            print(f\"\\nERROR: Found configuration defaults in {filepath}\")\n            print(\"Configuration parameters must be REQUIRED, not optional with defaults.\\n\")\n            for v in finder.violations:\n                print(f\"  Line {v['line']}: {v['object']}.get('{v['key']}', {v['default']})\")\n            print()\n            print(\"Fix by using one of these patterns:\")\n            print(\"  1.

Failures must be immediate and loud.\n```\n\n### Layer 5: Retroactive Audit (CLEANUP)\n\n**Script:** `bot/scripts/audit_config_defaults.py`\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Audit codebase for existing configuration default violations.\"\"\"\n# Similar to check_config_defaults.py but:\n# - Outputs report, doesn't block\n# - Categorizes violations by severity\n# - Provides migration guidance\n```\n\n**Run quarterly:**\n```bash\npython bot/scripts/audit_config_defaults.py buttermilk/ \u003e config_defaults_report.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## Technical Research Summary\n\n### Existing Linter Rules (NOT HELPFUL)\n\n**Ruff SIM401, Pylint R1715**: These rules actually **encourage** using `.get()` with defaults! They suggest replacing `if key in dict` checks with `.get()` calls. This is the **opposite** of what we need.\n\n**Ruff SIM910**: Only flags redundant `None` defaults, not all defaults.\n\n**Conclusion**: Standard linters work against our philosophy. Need custom solution.\n\n### Pydantic Validation (MOST PROMISING)\n\n- `BaseModel` with Field() and no default → raises `ValidationError` if missing\n- `BaseSettings` validates defaults by default\n- `validate_default=True` on Field forces validation even with defaults\n- Already used in buttermilk for some config\n\n**Best Practice**: Use Pydantic for ALL configuration going forward.\n\n### Custom AST Analysis\n\nPython's `ast` module provides `NodeVisitor` to traverse AST and detect patterns.\n- Can find all `.get()` calls\n- Can check if called on config-like objects\n- Can verify presence of default argument\n- See Layer 2 implementation above\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Immediate Protection (1-2 hours)\n\n**Goal**: Block NEW violations starting today\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Create `bot/scripts/check_config_defaults.py` (AST checker)\n2. Add pre-commit hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`\n3. Install pre-commit: `uv pip install pre-commit \u0026\u0026 pre-commit install`\n4. Test on host.py to verify it catches existing violations\n5. Update INSTRUCTIONS.md with explicit `.get()` anti-pattern\n6. Update DEVELOPMENT.md with configuration best practices\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- [ ] AST checker script created and tested\n- [ ] Pre-commit hook installed and working\n- [ ] Instructions updated with specific anti-patterns\n- [ ] Test commit blocked when violating pattern\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- New code with `.get()` on config objects is blocked at commit\n- Error message explains why and shows alternatives\n- Developer can understand how to fix\n\n### Phase 2: Code Review Integration (2-3 hours)\n\n**Goal**: Catch violations in review process\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Add configuration default check to code-review agent rules\n2. Update code-review agent to flag `.get()` patterns\n3. Add examples of correct vs incorrect patterns\n4. Test code-review agent on PRs with config changes\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- [ ] code-review agent rules updated\n- [ ] Test cases for config default detection\n- [ ] Documentation of review criteria\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Code-review agent flags config defaults in PRs\n- Provides helpful guidance on correct patterns\n- Links to relevant documentation\n\n### Phase 3: Legacy Code Cleanup (Ongoing)\n\n**Goal**: Fix existing violations systematically\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Run audit script to generate violation report\n2. Categorize violations:\n   - Critical: Config parameters affecting data integrity\n   - High: Config parameters affecting behavior\n   - Medium: Config parameters for convenience features\n   - Low: Legitimate dictionary lookups (false positives)\n3. Fix critical violations first\n4. Create issues for each category\n5. Migrate to Pydantic where feasible\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- [ ] Audit report generated\n- [ ] Violations categorized by severity\n- [ ] Critical violations fixed\n- [ ] Migration plan for remaining violations\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Zero critical config defaults remain\n- Clear plan for addressing all violations\n- Pydantic used for all new configuration\n\n### Phase 4: Long-Term Maintenance (Quarterly)\n\n**Goal**: Prevent regression, ensure compliance\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Run audit quarterly\n2. Review pre-commit hook effectiveness\n3. Update config object detection patterns\n4. Refine false positive filtering\n5. Monitor for new violations\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- [ ] Quarterly audit reports\n- [ ] Pre-commit hook refinements\n- [ ] Updated documentation\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Zero new violations introduced\n- All config uses Pydantic or explicit validation\n- Pattern recognized across all projects\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### Immediate (Phase 1):\n1. `bot/scripts/check_config_defaults.py` - Create AST checker\n2. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Add hook configuration\n3. `pyproject.toml` or `requirements-dev.txt` - Add pre-commit dependency\n4. `bot/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Add explicit `.get()` anti-pattern to Core Axioms\n5. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Add configuration best practices section\n\n### Short-term (Phase 2):\n6. `bot/agents/code-review.md` - Add config default detection rules\n7. `bot/docs/CODE-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` - Add config validation item\n\n### Medium-term (Phase 3):\n8. `bot/scripts/audit_config_defaults.py` - Create audit script\n9. `buttermilk/agents/flowcontrol/host.py` - Fix immediate violations\n10. Other files identified by audit (prioritize by severity)\n\n### Long-term (Phase 4):\n11. Quarterly updates to audit and checker scripts\n12. Documentation improvements based on learnings\n\n---\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- **#87**: Systemic failures in venv file modification prevention (same enforcement pattern)\n- **#84**: Agent Instruction Binding (enforcement through configuration)\n- **#82**: Python execution policy needs stronger enforcement\n- **#51**: Submodule independence violations\n- **#49**: Hierarchical configuration system for agent instructions\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**How we know this is fixed:**\n\n1. **Technical Enforcement**:\n   - Pre-commit hook blocks new violations\n   - Code-review agent flags violations in PRs\n   - Zero new `.get()` config defaults merged\n\n2. **Code Quality**:\n   - All new configuration uses Pydantic\n   - Audit shows \u003c 10 remaining violations\n   - Critical violations (data integrity) = 0\n\n3. **Cultural Shift**:\n   - Developers understand fail-fast philosophy\n   - `.get()` defaults recognized as anti-pattern\n   - Documentation requests show pattern awareness\n\n4. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Configuration errors fail immediately\n   - No silent misconfiguration in production\n   - Research data provably correct\n\n**Review Period**: 3 months of error-free operation before considering resolved\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should we add similar checks for other anti-patterns (mutable defaults, broad excepts)?\n2. Can we integrate this with CI/CD to block PRs automatically?\n3. Should the checker be stricter (block ALL .get() with defaults) or permissive (only known config objects)?\n4. How to handle third-party libraries that use .get() pattern?\n5. Should we create a \"config object\" base class that enforces this?\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps (User Decision Needed)\n\n1. Approve Phase 1 implementation? (AST checker + pre-commit hook)\n2. Priority for Phase 3 cleanup? (Should we fix all 373 instances or just critical ones?)\n3. Scope of checker? (Strict vs permissive detection)\n4. Add to buttermilk or keep in academicOps?\n\n**If approved, trainer will implement Phase 1 immediately.**","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-15T06:24:04Z","updated_at":"2025-10-15T07:06:10Z","closed_at":"2025-10-15T06:40:38Z","labels":["infrastructure","prompts"]}
{"id":"aops-98","title":"code-review agent approved test with mocked internal functions (violation of CODE.md line 10)","description":"## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe code-review agent approved test code that violated a critical rule in CODE.md line 10:\n\n\u003e Tests NEVER mock or fake internal logic or objects. Any tests that operate WITHIN the bounds of our codebase MUST be live code\n\n### What Happened\n\nIn test_llm_core.py lines 485-533, the test `test_template_metadata_preserved_in_result` mocks internal functions:\n\n```python\n# Line 501: Mocking internal _fill_template method\nwith patch.object(core, \"_fill_template\") as mock_fill:\n    mock_fill.return_value = [UserMessage(content=\"Test\", source=\"test\")]\n    \n    # Line 504: Manually setting internal state instead of real execution\n    core.template_metadata = {\n        \"template_name\": \"test_template\",\n        \"template_hash\": \"abc123def456\",\n        \"unfilled_vars\": []\n    }\n    \n    # Line 510: Mocking another internal method\n    with patch.object(core, \"_call_llm_with_trace\") as mock_call:\n        mock_call.return_value = CreateResult(...)\n```\n\nThese are internal functions of the LLMCore class being tested. The test should use real implementations, not mocks.\n\n### Why the Code-Review Agent Failed\n\nThe code-review agent's instructions (.claude/agents/code-review.md) define a clear validation process:\n\n1. Line 43: \"Load Validation Rules: Read validation files using the shadow file fallback hierarchy\"\n2. Line 18-21: \"Read and parse all rules from validation files\"\n\nThe agent correctly found and read bot/agents/CODE.md, which contains line 10 prohibiting internal mocking.\n\n**However**: The agent's validation checklist did NOT include this rule when checking the test file. The agent approved the test despite the clear violation.\n\n### Systemic Impact\n\nThis is the EXACT type of failure the fail-fast philosophy is designed to prevent:\n\n1. Bug in llm_core.py caused template_hash to be lost (line 230 dict replacement)\n2. Test was written with mocked internal functions\n3. Test \"passed\" because mocks bypass the actual broken code path\n4. Code-review agent approved it\n5. Real bug remains undetected until production failures\n\nFrom GitHub issue #22: **2,552 trace records (59% of traces)** failed dbt validation because template_hash was missing. This test would NOT have caught that if the mocks had been in place from the start.\n\n## Solution Requirements\n\nThe code-review agent must:\n\n1. **Parse CODE.md rules into explicit checklist items** when reviewing test files\n2. **Specifically check for unittest.mock imports** in test files\n3. **Validate that any `patch` or `MagicMock` usage** only targets external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.), NOT internal project code\n4. **Block commits** that mock internal functions with specific reference to CODE.md line 10\n\n### Detection Pattern\n\n```python\n# PROHIBITED in unit tests:\npatch.object(internal_class, \"method_name\")  # internal to our codebase\npatch(\"buttermilk.module.function\")  # our own modules\n\n# ALLOWED in integration tests where real deps are impractical:\npatch(\"requests.get\")  # external library\npatch(\"google.cloud.bigquery.Client\")  # external service\n```\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Explicit validation required**: Code-review agent must produce a checklist showing it verified the \"no internal mocking\" rule for any test file with unittest.mock imports.\n\n**Example passing validation output:**\n```\n### Test Standards\n- ✅ No internal mocking - PASS\n  - File: tests/unit/test_foo.py\n  - Verified: All patch() calls target external dependencies only\n  - Evidence: `patch(\"requests.post\")` at line 42 (external), no internal mocks found\n```\n\n**Example blocking validation output:**\n```\n### Test Standards  \n- ❌ No internal mocking - FAIL\n  - File: tests/unit/test_llm_core.py:501\n  - Issue: `patch.object(core, \"_fill_template\")` mocks internal LLMCore method\n  - Rule: CODE.md line 10 prohibits mocking internal logic\n  - Fix: Use real LLMCore._fill_template() with actual template files\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #100: Silent configuration defaults violate fail-fast (same pattern - bypassing real validation)\n- #22: Template hash missing from 59% of traces (the bug this test was supposed to catch)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-15T10:18:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-15T23:06:46Z","closed_at":"2025-10-15T23:06:46Z","labels":["prompts"]}

Instead, agent surfaced academicOps development issues first. This is the opposite of what user wants:\n- User is in PRIVATE workspace for their research work\n- Should focus on user's strategic planning, not framework development\n- Framework development is secondary, happens when needed\n\n## Root Cause\n\n`validate_env.py` (SessionStart hook) loads instructions without priority awareness:\n\n1. **bot/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md** (PUBLIC framework) - loads first\n2. **docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md** (PRIVATE user needs) - loads second\n\nBoth injected with equal prominence. Generic framework problems surface before user-specific strategic needs.\n\n## Why This Happens\n\n**Volume imbalance**: Generic instructions contain more actionable \"problems to fix\" (axioms, prohibitions, development issues) vs user context (project descriptions, workflow descriptions).\n\n**No context detection**: Script doesn't:\n- Detect current repository (is this academicOps development or user work?)\n- Prioritize based on user intent signals\n- Emphasize user-specific needs over framework issues\n\n**Equal treatment**: Both files injected as \"Required Agent Instructions\" with no hierarchy indicating which should take priority.\n\n## User Requirements\n\nWhen user starts session in $OUTER:\n1. **Strategic planning context** should surface first (goals, current priorities, active projects)\n2. **Framework development** should be background context, not primary agenda\n3. **Startup flow** should support user's actual work, not distract with meta-framework tasks\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #84: Configuration-based instruction enforcement (parent issue)\n- Related to SessionStart hook implementation\n\n## Options to Explore\n\n### Option A: Reverse Load Order\nLoad user-specific context FIRST, framework rules SECOND\n- Pros: Simple, emphasizes what user cares about\n- Cons: Doesn't solve volume imbalance\n\n### Option B: Mode Detection\nDetect context and adjust emphasis:\n- If in $OUTER → prioritize user strategic context\n- If in bot/ → prioritize framework development\n- If in projects/ → prioritize project-specific context\n\n### Option C: Separate Strategic vs Framework Hooks\n- Strategic hook: Loads user planning context (goals, tasks, priorities)\n- Framework hook: Loads agent rules and constraints\n- User can configure which activates when\n\n### Option D: Simplified Generic Rules\n- Reduce bot/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md to pure axioms (no development agenda)\n- Move \"problems to fix\" to separate developer-focused context\n- Generic file becomes truly generic, not academicOps-specific\n\n### Option E: Explicit Priority Markers\nAdd framing in injected context:\n```\n# PRIMARY CONTEXT: User Work\n[docs/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md content]\n\n# BACKGROUND: Framework Rules\n[bot/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md content]\n```\n\n## Experimental Methodology Required\n\nPer TRAINER.md updates:\n1.

This results in generated plans that contradict the workflow's core principles.\n\n## Evidence\n\nFrom session 2026-01-16-1ffd8f44:\n\n1. Hydrator invoked for batch processing task (find axioms/heuristics)\n2. Hydrator output included: `Workflow: [[workflows/batch-processing]] (with [[workflows/feature-dev]] for workflow documentation)`\n3.

Example: custodiet writes analysis paragraphs before finally saying \"OK\" even though instructions explicitly forbid this.\n\n## Root Cause Category\n**Clarity Failure** - Instructions say WHAT to output but don't signal that output will be programmatically parsed.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n1. Add structured output format (JSON or specific template) to agent instructions\n2. Include explicit \"this will be parsed programmatically\" signal\n3. Document this as a general enforcement pattern for agent instructions\n\n## Hypothesis\nWhen agents believe their output will be parsed by code, they conform more strictly to templates because:\n- They've seen training data where malformed output breaks parsers\n- The \"programmatic parsing\" framing makes format violations feel consequential\n\n## Success Metric\n- Custodiet outputs exactly \"OK\" or exactly the 4-line BLOCK format\n- No preamble, no analysis, no elaboration","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nic@suzor.com","created_at":"2026-01-17T10:26:19.177877723+10:00","created_by":"Nicolas Suzor","updated_at":"2026-01-17T10:28:13.443077859+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T10:28:13.443077859+10:00","close_reason":"Applied structured output technique: added 'parsed programmatically' signal to custodiet.md and documented the pattern in ENFORCEMENT.md"}

{"id":"aops-tobs","title":"bug: transcript.py uses first matching reflection instead of last","description":"When extract_reflection_from_entries() encounters a session with multiple Framework Reflection sections, it should extract ALL of them because they may represent different work sessions within a single Claude session.\n\n## Original problem\nReturns immediately on first match rather than collecting all reflections.\n\n## Updated requirement (2026-01-17)\nSessions with multiple reflections should produce MULTIPLE session insight files, not just pick the last one. Each Framework Reflection represents a distinct work session that should be preserved.\n\n## Key changes needed\n1. extract_reflection_from_entries() should return ALL reflections (list) instead of single reflection\n2. _process_reflection() must loop over multiple reflections and create separate insights files\n3. Session file naming needs update: one transcript may produce multiple insight JSONs (e.g., ...-0.json, ...-1.json or timestamped)\n4. Transcript markdown generation: consider whether to show all reflections in one file or split\n\n## Files to modify\n- aops-core/lib/transcript_parser.py: extract_reflection_from_entries() (lines 120-173) - change return type to list\n- aops-core/scripts/transcript.py: _process_reflection() - loop over multiple reflections\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n1. Multi-reflection sessions produce N separate insights JSON files (one per reflection)\n2. Each insights file is independently valid\n3. Single-reflection sessions continue working (produce 1 file as before)\n4. File naming scheme clearly indicates which reflection is which\n5.

The storage base class assumes Record types throughout\n4. No validation that required schemas exist before operations\n\n## Impact\n\n- Data corruption risk: Wrong fields added to tables\n- Type safety violations: Runtime errors when wrong types are saved\n- Violates explicit configuration principle: System makes assumptions instead of failing fast\n\n## Solution Plan\n\n1. Remove ALL implicit defaults and schema inference\n2. Make schema configuration REQUIRED for BigQuery storage\n3. Make the storage interface generic to handle any Pydantic model\n4. Fail fast if schema is missing or invalid\n5. Update auto_create to only create tables, never modify existing schemas\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n- [ ] Remove `get_record_bigquery_schema()` fallback in `create()`\n- [ ] Add schema validation in `__init__` - fail if schema_path missing or invalid\n- [ ] Make storage interface generic using TypeVar\n- [ ] Update auto_create logic to skip existing tables\n- [ ] Add explicit error messages for missing schemas\n- [ ] Update documentation to emphasize NO IMPLICIT DEFAULTS","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-07-27T07:46:26Z","updated_at":"2025-08-08T08:08:38Z","closed_at":"2025-08-08T08:08:38Z"}

Column mappings allow users to map BigQuery source columns to Record target fields, but the SELECT query doesn't respect these mappings.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nThe `_build_select_query` method should:\n1. Load the schema to determine expected fields\n2. Build the SELECT list dynamically:\n   - If column mappings exist, select the source columns (values in the mapping dict)\n   - If no mappings, select columns as defined in the schema\n3.

{"id":"bm-110","title":"Add standalone tracing to all non-orchestrator entry points","description":"# Add Standalone Tracing to All Non-Orchestrator Entry Points\n\n## Overview\n\nFollowing the implementation of standalone tracing support (PR that adds `standalone_trace.py`), we need to extend tracing coverage to all entry points that run outside of an orchestrator context. This will ensure consistent observability across all execution modes.\n\n## Background\n\nThe standalone tracing module (`buttermilk/_core/standalone_trace.py`) was created to provide parent trace contexts for agents running outside orchestrators. Currently implemented in:\n- `buttermilk/data/vector.py` - Vector database batch processing\n\n## Entry Points Requiring Tracing\n\n### 1. CLI Modes (`buttermilk/runner/cli.py`)\n\n#### Batch Mode (lines 98-100)\n```python\ncase \"batch\":\n    asyncio.run(flow_runner.create_batch(...))\n```\n- Creates batch jobs by adding RunRequests to queue\n- Needs trace context for job creation process\n\n#### Batch Run Mode (lines 102-112)\n```python\ncase \"batch_run\":\n    asyncio.run(flow_runner.run_batch_job(...))\n```\n- Processes jobs from queue\n- Each job should have its own trace context\n\n#### Pub/Sub Mode (lines 167-184)\n```python\ncase \"pub/sub\":\n    batch_cli_main(conf)\n```\n- Listens to Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n- Each message processing should be traced\n\n#### Console Mode (lines 75-96)\n```python\ncase \"console\":\n    asyncio.run(flow_runner.run_flow(...))\n```\n- Single flow execution\n- Should have trace context for the entire run\n\n### 2. API Endpoints (`buttermilk/api/flow.py`)\n\n#### HTTP Request Handlers\n- Session creation endpoints\n- Flow execution via API calls\n- Each request should create a trace context\n\n#### WebSocket Connections (line 181)\n```python\n@app.websocket(\"/ws/{session_id}\")\nasync def websocket_endpoint(...)\n```\n- Long-lived connections need special handling\n- Consider per-message or per-operation tracing\n\n### 3. Slack Bot (`buttermilk/runner/slackbot.py`)\n\n#### Event Handlers\n```python\nasync def register_handlers(...)\n```\n- Each Slack command/event should create a trace\n- Trace should span the entire flow execution\n\n### 4. Streamlit Interface (line 114-127)\n- Web UI interactions\n- Each user action triggering a flow should be traced\n\n### 5. Scheduled/Background Tasks\n- Any cron jobs or periodic tasks\n- Background cleanup or maintenance operations\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### 1. Create Tracing Decorators\n\n```python\n# buttermilk/_core/tracing_decorators.py\nfrom functools import wraps\nfrom buttermilk._core.standalone_trace import create_standalone_trace\n\ndef traced_entry_point(name: str, **default_attributes):\n    \"\"\"Decorator for adding tracing to entry points.\"\"\"\n    def decorator(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            # Extract relevant attributes from args/kwargs\n            attributes = {**default_attributes}\n            # Add dynamic attributes based on function args\n            \n            async with create_standalone_trace(name, **attributes) as trace:\n                # Inject trace context if needed\n                return await func(*args, trace_context=trace, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n```\n\n### 2. Update Entry Points\n\nExample for batch mode:\n```python\nasync def run_batch_job(self, callback_to_ui: Callable, max_jobs: int = 1, \n                       wait_for_completion: bool = True, trace_context=None) -\u003e None:\n    \"\"\"Pull and run jobs from the queue.\"\"\"\n    # If no trace context provided, create one\n    if not trace_context:\n        async with create_standalone_trace(\"batch_job_runner\", max_jobs=max_jobs) as trace:\n            await self._run_batch_job_impl(callback_to_ui, max_jobs, wait_for_completion, trace)\n    else:\n        await self._run_batch_job_impl(callback_to_ui, max_jobs, wait_for_completion, trace_context)\n```\n\n### 3. FastAPI Middleware\n\n```python\n@app.middleware(\"http\")\nasync def tracing_middleware(request: Request, call_next):\n    \"\"\"Add trace context to all HTTP requests.\"\"\"\n    attributes = {\n        \"method\": request.method,\n        \"path\": request.url.path,\n        \"client\": request.client.host if request.client else None,\n    }\n    \n    async with create_standalone_trace(f\"http_{request.method}_{request.url.path}\", **attributes) as trace:\n        # Store trace in request state for handlers to use\n        request.state.trace_context = trace\n        response = await call_next(request)\n        return response\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n1. **Unit Tests**\n   - Test trace context creation for each entry point\n   - Verify trace attributes are correctly set\n   - Test error handling within trace contexts\n\n2. **Integration Tests**\n   - Verify traces appear in Weave UI\n   - Test trace hierarchy (parent-child relationships)\n   - Verify no memory leaks from long-running traces\n\n3. **Performance Tests**\n   - Measure overhead of tracing\n   - Test with high-volume scenarios (batch processing, API load)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. All entry points have consistent tracing\n2. Traces are visible in Weave UI with proper hierarchy\n3. No performance degradation\n4. Error scenarios are properly traced\n5. Documentation updated with tracing guidelines\n\n## Priority Order\n\n1. **High Priority**\n   - Batch processing modes (impacts research workflows)\n   - API endpoints (production services)\n   \n2. **Medium Priority**\n   - Slack bot handlers\n   - Console mode\n   \n3. **Low Priority**\n   - Streamlit interface\n   - Development/debug endpoints\n\n## Notes\n\n- Consider adding trace sampling for high-volume endpoints\n- WebSocket connections need special consideration for long-lived traces\n- Batch jobs should have both job-level and item-level traces\n- Consider adding trace context to error responses for debugging","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-08-06T08:23:23Z","updated_at":"2026-01-17T13:47:03.41069907+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T13:47:03.41069907+10:00"}

{"id":"bm-117","title":"Refactor for Modularity, Usability, and Dependency Management","description":"### **GitHub Issue Draft**\n\n**Title: Refactor for Modularity, Usability, and Dependency Management**\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe Buttermilk project has rapidly grown, developing a powerful core (the `BM` object and its LLMOps capabilities) and a set of complex, valuable flows. However, the current structure presents several challenges for new users and for integrating Buttermilk into different use cases. This issue outlines a plan to refactor the project for better modularity, usability, and dependency management, making it more accessible to a wider range of academic users.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\n1.  **Poor Organization \u0026 Steep Learning Curve:** The project is difficult for newcomers to navigate. The primary entrypoint (`runner/cli.py`) is powerful but complex, obscuring the simpler, underlying functionalities.\n2.  **Monolithic Dependencies:** The project has a large, undifferentiated set of dependencies. A user who only wants to use the core logging and LLM features is forced to install libraries for vector databases, API servers, and more, making the package unnecessarily heavy.\n3.  **Lack of Simple Entrypoints:** There is no straightforward way for a user to perform a simple task, like making a single LLM call using the project's robust LLMOps framework, without understanding the entire flow/orchestrator system.\n4.  **Hidden Applications:** Valuable, self-contained functionalities (e.g., the `judge.py` agent or the `trans.yaml` flow) are not exposed as easy-to-run, standalone applications.\n5.  **Limited Reusability:** It's not clear how to import Buttermilk as a library into an external project to leverage its capabilities, such as the RAG pipeline, without pulling in the entire application structure.\n\n**Proposed Plan:**\n\nThis plan is broken down into four main initiatives that build on each other to create a more modular, flexible, and user-friendly ecosystem.\n\n#### Initiative 1: Modularize Dependencies with `pyproject.toml`\n\nTo address the monolithic dependency issue, we will restructure `pyproject.toml` to define optional dependency groups. This will allow users to install only the parts of Buttermilk they need.\n\n**Proposed Groups:**\n\n*   `buttermilk[core]`: The minimal set for core functionality: `BM` object, Hydra config, logging, tracing, and basic LLM client access.\n*   `buttermilk[server]`: Adds `fastapi` and `uvicorn` for running the API server.\n*   `buttermilk[vector]`: Adds `chromadb`, `semchunk`, and other libraries needed for vector database operations.\n*   `buttermilk[notebook]`: Adds `jupyter`, `pandas`, `seaborn` for interactive analysis.\n*   `buttermilk[slack]`: Adds dependencies for the Slack bot.\n*   `buttermilk[dev]` or `buttermilk[all]`: Installs all dependencies for development.\n\n**Action:**\n*   Modify `pyproject.toml` to specify `[project.optional-dependencies]`.\n\n---\n\n#### Initiative 2: Create a Simplified \"Core API\" for Quick Use\n\nTo lower the barrier to entry, we will create a high-level, simplified API for common tasks, inspired by the `buttermilk/utils/nb.py` script. This will provide a gentle on-ramp for new users.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nCreate a new module, e.g., `buttermilk.easy`, with simple functions that wrap the underlying complexity.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\n# In a user's script or notebook\nfrom buttermilk.easy import init, llm, judge\n\n# Initializes the core BM object behind the scenes\ninit(job=\"my-experiment\")\n\n# Simple, one-shot LLM call\nresponse = llm(\"What is the capital of Australia?\")\nprint(response)\n\n# Use the Judge agent directly\njudgment = judge(\n    text_to_evaluate=\"Some text...\",\n    criteria=fb_hate\n)\nprint(judgment.conclusion, judgment.prediction)\n```\n\n**Action:**\n*   Create `buttermilk/easy.py` (or a similar name).\n*   Implement `init()` which instantiates a default `BM` object.\n*   Implement wrapper functions like `llm()` and `judge()` that instantiate the corresponding agents with sensible defaults and execute them.\n\n---\n\n#### Initiative 3: Expose Flows as Standalone Applications\n\nTo make complex flows like `trans.yaml` easily accessible, we will create dedicated CLI entrypoints for them.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nUse the `[project.scripts]` table in `pyproject.toml` to create command-line wrappers. These scripts would call the main `buttermilk.runner.cli:main` function with pre-set arguments.\n\n**Example `pyproject.toml` entry:**\n```toml\n[project.scripts]\nbuttermilk-assess-journalism = \"buttermilk.scripts.run_trans_flow:main\"\n```\n\nThe `run_trans_flow.py` script would be a thin wrapper that invokes the main CLI with `run.mode=api` and `flow=trans`.\n\n**Action:**\n*   Create a `scripts/` directory for these entrypoint wrappers.\n*   Add entries to `pyproject.toml` to expose them as commands.\n\n---\n\n#### Initiative 4: Document \"Cookbook\" Recipes for Different Use Cases\n\nTo tie everything together and guide users, we will create a new \"Cookbook\" or \"Use Cases\" section in the documentation.\n\n**Proposed Recipes:**\n\n1.  **\"Your First LLM Call in 5 Lines\":** Demonstrates using the new `buttermilk.easy` API (Initiative 2).\n2.  **\"Running the Journalism Quality Assessment Server\":** Shows how to run a packaged flow as a service (Initiative 3).\n3.  **\"Building a RAG System in Your Own Project\":** A tutorial on how to:\n    *   `pip install buttermilk[core,vector]` (Initiative 1).\n    *   Copy the `zot.yaml` and related configs.\n    *   Use a new `buttermilk.easy.run_flow_from_config()` function to run the RAG flow programmatically from an external project.\n4.  **\"Developing a New Flow\":** The existing, more advanced documentation for power users.\n\n**Action:**\n*   Structure and write the new documentation pages.\n*   Develop the `run_flow_from_config()` helper function to support the RAG use case.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-08-15T05:33:25Z","updated_at":"2026-01-17T13:38:08.108423709+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T13:38:08.108423709+10:00"}

{"id":"bm-127","title":"Enable Multi-Iteration Tool Calling in LLM Agents","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently, LLM agents can only perform one iteration of tool calling:\n1. LLM generates tool calls\n2. Tools are executed \n3. LLM gets tool results and generates final response\n4. Done\n\nThis limits agents' ability to:\n- Reflect on tool results and make additional informed tool calls\n- Iteratively refine searches or analyses\n- Perform complex multi-step reasoning that requires multiple tool interactions\n\n## Current Architecture\n\nFrom `docs/reference/llm_agent.md`, the call flow is:\n```\nAgent.invoke() → LLMAgent._process() → AutoGenWrapper.call_chat() → AutoGenWrapper.create()\n```\n\n`AutoGenWrapper.call_chat()` currently:\n1. Makes initial LLM call via `create()`\n2. If tool calls requested, executes tools via `_execute_tools()`\n3. Makes ONE follow-up LLM call with tool results\n4. Returns final result\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n`buttermilk/agents/rag/iterative_rag_agent.py` implements this manually with:\n- Custom while loop with max_iterations\n- Manual chat history management\n- Direct calls to `model_client.call_chat()` multiple times\n- Custom tool execution logic (duplicating AutoGenWrapper functionality)\n\nThis works but creates code duplication and complexity.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify `AutoGenWrapper.call_chat()` to support configurable multi-iteration:\n\n```python\nasync def call_chat(\n    self, \n    messages, \n    tools_list=None, \n    cancellation_token=None, \n    schema=None,\n    max_tool_iterations=1,  # New parameter, default maintains backward compatibility\n    iteration_timeout=None  # Optional timeout per iteration\n):\n    # Implementation that allows multiple tool call cycles\n```\n\n### Safety Mechanisms\n1. **Max iterations limit** (configurable, default=1 for backward compatibility)\n2. **Timeout mechanism** (prevent hanging agents)\n3. **Loop detection** (detect identical consecutive tool calls)\n4. **Clear logging** (iteration progress and stopping reasons)\n\n### Benefits\n- Cleaner, simpler code (no custom loops in agents)\n- Centralized iteration logic in AutoGenWrapper\n- Backward compatible (default max_iterations=1)\n- Consistent tool execution behavior\n- Better error handling and monitoring\n\n## Alternative: Leverage AutoGen\n\nInvestigate if AutoGen already provides multi-iteration capabilities we can delegate to.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Research AutoGen's built-in multi-iteration support\n2. Design the modified `call_chat()` method\n3. Implement with safety mechanisms\n4. Migrate `IterativeRagAgent` to use the new approach\n5. Add configuration options for iteration limits\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `AutoGenWrapper.call_chat()` supports configurable multi-iteration\n- [ ] Safety mechanisms prevent runaway agents\n- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained\n- [ ] `IterativeRagAgent` simplified to use new approach\n- [ ] Clear documentation and examples\n- [ ] Performance monitoring for iteration behavior","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-08-20T00:06:51Z","updated_at":"2026-01-17T13:38:08.121225988+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T13:38:08.121225988+10:00"}

{"id":"bm-129","title":"Feature: Session-based Flow Persistence and URL-based Session Loading","description":"## Summary\n\nImplement persistent storage for chat flows with session-based URLs, allowing users to load and continue past conversations. This feature will expose session IDs in URLs and automatically save/restore all flow messages to enable reproducible academic research sessions.\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, Buttermilk sessions are ephemeral and exist only in memory during server runtime. When users refresh the page or restart the server, all conversation history is lost. For academic research purposes, we need persistent sessions that can be shared, referenced, and continued across browser sessions.\n\n## Current Architecture Analysis\n\n### Existing Session Management\n- **Backend**: `SessionManager` provides in-memory session storage with 1-hour expiration\n- **Frontend**: Session ID stored in localStorage via `sessionStore.ts`\n- **WebSocket**: Sessions identified by `session_id` parameter in `/ws/{session_id}` endpoint\n- **Message Flow**: Messages processed through `MessageService.format_message_for_client()`\n\n### Current Storage\n- **Client-side**: Limited localStorage in `messageHistoryStore.ts` (50 messages max, lightweight format)\n- **Server-side**: No persistent storage - all state lost on restart\n- **Message Types**: Various agent outputs (Judge, Researcher, Assessment, etc.) with metadata\n\n## Proposed Implementation\n\n### Phase 1: URL-based Session Routing\n\n**1.1 Frontend Route Changes**\n- Add new route: `/session/[sessionId]` that renders the terminal interface\n- Modify `/terminal` to redirect to `/session/{generated-session-id}` \n- Update session initialization to read from URL parameter first, fallback to localStorage\n\n```typescript\n// New route: src/routes/session/[sessionId]/+page.svelte\n// Similar to current terminal page but extracts sessionId from URL params\n```\n\n**1.2 Session Store Enhancement**\n```typescript\n// Modify sessionStore.ts to:\n- Read session ID from URL parameters when available\n- Update URL when session changes (using goto() with replaceState)\n- Maintain backward compatibility with localStorage fallback\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Server-side Message Persistence\n\n**2.1 Message Storage Service**\n```python\n# New: buttermilk/api/services/session_storage.py\nclass SessionStorageService:\n    def save_message(session_id: str, message: ChatMessage) -\u003e None\n    def get_session_messages(session_id: str) -\u003e List[ChatMessage]\n    def session_exists(session_id: str) -\u003e bool\n```\n\n**2.2 JSON File Storage**\n- Store messages in `data/sessions/{session_id}.json`\n- Each file contains array of ChatMessage objects with full metadata\n- Exclude system status updates (keep only substantive messages)\n- Include agent_info, timestamps, token usage, costs for research traceability\n\n**2.3 WebSocket Message Interceptor**\n```python\n# Modify existing WebSocket handler to persist messages\n# In buttermilk/api/routes.py or similar:\nasync def websocket_handler():\n    # ... existing logic ...\n    \n    # Before sending to client:\n    if should_persist_message(formatted_message):\n        await SessionStorageService.save_message(session_id, formatted_message)\n    \n    await websocket.send_json(formatted_message)\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Session Restoration\n\n**3.1 Backend Session Loading**\n```python\n# New endpoint: GET /api/session/{session_id}/messages\nasync def get_session_messages(session_id: str):\n    if not SessionStorageService.session_exists(session_id):\n        raise HTTPException(404, \"Session not found\")\n    \n    messages = SessionStorageService.get_session_messages(session_id)\n    return {\"messages\": messages}\n```\n\n**3.2 Frontend Message Restoration**\n```typescript\n// In ChatTerminal.svelte or new restoration service:\nasync function restoreSessionMessages(sessionId: string) {\n    const response = await fetch(`/api/session/${sessionId}/messages`);\n    if (response.ok) {\n        const data = await response.json();\n        // Send each message over WebSocket to restore UI state\n        for (const message of data.messages) {\n            handleMessage(message); // Existing message handler\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**3.3 WebSocket Restoration Protocol**\n- When client connects to existing session, server checks for stored messages\n- Option A: Send all messages individually over WebSocket (maintains existing flow)\n- Option B: Send bulk message array as special message type\n- Client processes and displays messages in chronological order\n\n### Phase 4: GCP Integration (Future)\n\n**4.1 Cloud Storage Upload**\n```python\n# Background task to upload session files to GCS\nasync def upload_session_to_gcp(session_id: str):\n    local_file = f\"data/sessions/{session_id}.json\"\n    blob_name = f\"sessions/{session_id}.json\"\n    # Upload to GCS bucket\n```\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n\n### Message Filtering\n```python\ndef should_persist_message(message: ChatMessage) -\u003e bool:\n    \"\"\"Determine if message should be saved to disk\"\"\"\n    exclude_types = [\"system_update\", \"system_message\"]\n    return message.type not in exclude_types\n```\n\n### URL Structure\n```\nCurrent: /terminal\nNew:     /session/{session-id}\n         /terminal -\u003e redirects to /session/{new-session-id}\n```\n\n### Data Structures\n```json\n// Session file format: data/sessions/{session-id}.json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2024-01-01T10:00:00Z\",\n  \"last_updated\": \"2024-01-01T10:30:00Z\", \n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"record\",\n      \"message_id\": \"msg123\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T10:05:00Z\",\n      \"outputs\": {...},\n      \"agent_info\": {...},\n      \"prompt_tokens\": 150,\n      \"completion_tokens\": 200,\n      \"cost_usd\": 0.0045\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n- Graceful degradation when session files are corrupted\n- Fallback to new session if restoration fails\n- Clear error messages for users when sessions are not found\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Reproducible Research**: Academics can share session URLs for peer review\n2. **Persistent Conversations**: No data loss on browser refresh or server restart  \n3. **Audit Trail**: Complete message history with token usage and costs\n4. **Collaboration**: Multiple researchers can reference the same session\n5. **Simple Implementation**: JSON files are human-readable and easy to debug\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] URLs expose session IDs (e.g., `/session/abc123-def456`)\n- [ ] Existing sessions load from disk when URL is accessed\n- [ ] All substantive messages are saved to JSON files automatically\n- [ ] Message restoration maintains chronological order and agent attribution\n- [ ] Session files exclude system status updates but include research-relevant metadata\n- [ ] Backward compatibility with current localStorage-based sessions\n- [ ] Error handling for corrupted or missing session files\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit Tests**: Session storage service CRUD operations\n2. **Integration Tests**: WebSocket message persistence flow\n3. **E2E Tests**: Complete session save/restore cycle via browser\n4. **Performance Tests**: Large session file loading times\n5. **Manual Tests**: URL sharing between different browsers\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Session search/indexing for researchers\n- Export sessions to academic formats (JSON, CSV)\n- Session metadata (tags, descriptions, participants)\n- Automatic session archival to GCP after inactivity\n- Session sharing permissions and access controls","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-08-21T06:49:21Z","updated_at":"2025-08-22T10:42:40Z","closed_at":"2025-08-22T10:42:40Z"}

This validator:\n\n1. Auto-generates a `unique_identifier` using `shortuuid.uuid()[:6]` \n2. Creates `agent_id` by combining `role` and `unique_identifier`\n3. Runs on every model creation/assignment due to `validate_assignment=True`\n\n## Current Implementation\n```python\n# From buttermilk/_core/config.py\nclass AgentConfig(BaseModel):\n    model_config = ConfigDict(\n        validate_assignment=True,  # Ensures validators run on assignment\n    )\n    \n    unique_identifier: str = Field(\n        default_factory=lambda: uuid()[:6],  # Generates a short unique ID\n        exclude=True,\n    )\n    \n    @model_validator(mode=\"after\")\n    def _generate_id_and_name(self) -\u003e Self:\n        # Generates agent_id = f\"{role}-{unique_identifier}\"\n        # This overwrites existing IDs during session loading\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Session Restoration Broken**: When sessions are loaded, agent IDs change unexpectedly\n- **Agent Reference Loss**: References to specific agents become invalid\n- **Inconsistent State**: The same agent configuration produces different IDs across loads\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe validator should be conditional and only generate IDs when they don't already exist:\n\n```python\n@model_validator(mode=\"after\")\ndef _generate_id_and_name(self) -\u003e Self:\n    # Only generate ID if not already set\n    if not self.agent_id:\n        current_role = self.role\n        current_unique_id = self.unique_identifier\n        intended_agent_id = f\"{current_role}-{current_unique_id}\" if current_role else current_unique_id\n        object.__setattr__(self, \"agent_id\", intended_agent_id)\n    # ... rest of naming logic\n```\n\n## Alternative Solution\n\nMove the ID generation logic to AgentVariants.expand() where it's specifically needed for generating variants, rather than running on every AgentConfig instantiation.\n\n## Files Affected\n\n- `buttermilk/_core/config.py` - AgentConfig class\n- Session loading/restoration functionality\n\n## Priority\n\nHigh - This breaks session persistence functionality which is critical for user experience.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-08-25T00:57:37Z","updated_at":"2025-08-25T02:20:01Z","closed_at":"2025-08-25T02:20:01Z"}

{"id":"bm-144","title":"Session-Centric Observability Architecture Migration","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe current Buttermilk observability architecture has fundamental design issues that make proper session isolation impossible:\n\n### Core Issues\n\n1. **API Server Observability Breakdown**: All sessions share a single global `run_id`, making it impossible to trace individual research tasks in API mode\n2. **Batch Inconsistency**: Batch tasks share run info locally but generate different run_ids when distributed\n3. **Configuration Duplication**: Each task logs identical infrastructure configs instead of proper hierarchical organization\n4. **Poor Granularity**: Can't distinguish between infrastructure setup vs actual research activities\n\n### Current Problems Demonstrated\n\n```python\n# API Server - ALL sessions share same run_id 😞\napp.state.bm = bm  # Global BM instance\n# session1.run_id == session2.run_id == server_startup_run_id\n\n# Batch - Inconsistent behavior 😞  \n# Local: all tasks share batch run_id\n# Distributed: each task gets different run_id\n\n# Configuration Reload - BM instances never update 😞\n# reload_configurations() only updates flows, not BM infrastructure\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution: Three-Tier Architecture\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nReplace the current overloaded \"run\" concept with three distinct tiers:\n\n1. **ExecutionContext** (Process-Level Infrastructure)\n   - **Purpose**: Manages shared infrastructure (clouds, secrets, LLMs)\n   - **Scope**: One per process/server lifetime\n   - **ID**: `execution_context_id`\n\n2. **ResearchRun** (Task Group Level)\n   - **Purpose**: Logical grouping of related research sessions\n   - **Scope**: Multiple sessions that belong together analytically\n   - **ID**: `research_run_id` (optional - only when grouping needed)\n   - **Examples**: Batch job, multi-session research project\n\n3. **Session** (Individual Task Level)\n   - **Purpose**: Individual flow/task execution\n   - **Scope**: Single orchestrator instance\n   -

This causes downstream code that checks `result_df.empty` to fail with an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'empty'`.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bm.run_query()` should either:\n1. Always return a DataFrame (empty if no results)\n2. Raise an exception that can be caught and handled appropriately\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nWhen a query fails, `bm.run_query()` logs the error and returns `None`, which breaks code that expects a DataFrame.\n\n## Example Code That Breaks\n\n```python\nresult_df = bm.run_query(query_sql)\nif not result_df.empty:  # AttributeError if query failed\n    # process results\n```\n\n## Workaround Required\n\n```python\nresult_df = bm.run_query(query_sql)\nif result_df is not None and not result_df.empty:  # Must check for None first\n    # process results\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects all dashboard code and data processing pipelines that use `bm.run_query()`. Users must defensively check for None before using DataFrame methods.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nOption 1: Always return a DataFrame\n```python\ndef run_query(self, sql):\n    try:\n        # existing query logic\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Query failed: {e}\")\n        return pd.DataFrame()  # Return empty DataFrame instead of None\n```\n\nOption 2: Let exceptions propagate\n```python\ndef run_query(self, sql):\n    # Don't catch exceptions, let them propagate to caller\n    # existing query logic without try/except\n    return result\n```\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Run any invalid query:\n```python\nbm = init(...)\nresult = bm.run_query(\"SELECT * FROM non_existent_table\")\nprint(type(result))  # \u003cclass 'NoneType'\u003e\n```\n\n2.

This terminates batch jobs that take longer than 30 minutes to complete.\n\n**Evidence from agent 272:**\n```\n{\"flow_name\": \"trans\", \"execution_time\": \"1800.04s\", \"success\": false, \"event\": \"Recorded flow execution\", ...}\n{\"session_id\": \"GcPH89gsgnBfCVdznawLto\", \"reason\": \"no_connections\", \"event\": \"Cleaning up session\", ...}\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `buttermilk/runner/flowrunner.py:856-860`:\n\n```python\nelif len(self.active_connections.get(session_id, set())) == 0:\n    # No active connections for extended period\n    time_since_activity = (datetime.now(UTC) - session.last_activity).total_seconds()\n    if time_since_activity \u003e 1800:  # 30 minutes without connections\n        cleanup_candidates.append((session_id, \"no_connections\"))\n```\n\nThis logic assumes all flows have WebSocket clients. **Batch jobs never have WebSocket connections** - they run headless via Pub/Sub workers.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Batch jobs \u003e 30 minutes are killed prematurely**\n- Marked as `success: false` even if they would have completed\n- Pub/Sub messages may not be acknowledged properly\n- Data processing pipelines are unreliable for long-running tasks\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Distinguish between interactive and batch sessions** - batch sessions should not be subject to no_connections timeout\n2. **Make timeout configurable** - 1800s is hardcoded, should respect `session_timeout` parameter\n3. **Track session mode** - add `session_mode` enum (INTERACTIVE, BATCH, CLI) to FlowRunContext\n4. **Update cleanup logic** - only apply no_connections check to INTERACTIVE sessions\n\n## Potential Solution Directions\n\n### Option 1: Session Mode Tracking\nAdd `session_mode` to `FlowRunContext`:\n```python\nclass SessionMode(str, Enum):\n    INTERACTIVE = \"interactive\"  # Has WebSocket, expect connections\n    BATCH = \"batch\"              # Headless, no connections expected\n    CLI = \"cli\"                  # Command-line, no connections expected\n```\n\nUpdate cleanup logic to skip no_connections check for non-interactive sessions.\n\n### Option 2: Use session_timeout Instead of Hardcoded Value\nReplace hardcoded 1800 with `session.session_timeout`, but this might be too long for interactive sessions that lose connection.\n\n### Option 3: Separate Timeouts\n- `interactive_disconnect_timeout`: 1800s (keep current behavior)\n- `batch_execution_timeout`: Much longer or infinite for batch jobs\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. How should we determine session mode at creation time?\n2. Should batch jobs have any timeout at all, or rely on orchestrator-level timeouts?\n3. What happens to batch jobs that genuinely hang - how do we detect and clean them up?\n4.

Fix KeepUndefinedAndCollect `__repr__` Override\n\n**File**: `buttermilk/utils/templating.py:415-424`\n\n```python\nclass KeepUndefinedAndCollect(Undefined):\n    def __str__(self) -\u003e str:\n        collected_undefined_vars.append(self._undefined_name)\n        return \"{{\" + str(self._undefined_name) + \"}}\"\n    \n    def __repr__(self) -\u003e str:  # ADD THIS\n        # pprint filter uses repr(), not str()\n        return self.__str__()\n```\n\n**Why**: The `pprint` filter calls `repr()` on Undefined objects, which returns `\"Undefined\"` instead of going through `__str__()` which tracks the variable.\n\n### 2. Add Type Validation Helper Filter\n\n```python\n# In templating.py\ndef strict_type(value, expected_type):\n    \"\"\"Validate variable type, fail-fast on mismatch.\"\"\"\n    type_map = {\n        'dict': dict,\n        'list': list,\n        'str': str,\n        'int': int,\n    }\n    \n    expected = type_map.get(expected_type)\n    if expected and not isinstance(value, expected):\n        raise TypeError(\n            f\"Expected {expected_type}, got {type(value).__name__}: {value!r}\"\n        )\n    return value\n\n# Register filter\nenv.filters['strict_type'] = strict_type\n```\n\n**Usage in templates**:\n```jinja2\n{# Validate expected is dict before using #}\n{{ expected | strict_type('dict') | pprint }}\n\n{# Validate answers is list #}\n{% for answer in answers | strict_type('list') %}\n  {{ answer }}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\n### 3. Add Template Linting Script\n\nCreate `scripts/lint_templates.py`:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Lint Jinja2 templates for common fail-fast violations.\n\nDetects:\n- Use of pprint filter without strict_type\n- Conditional checks that hide missing variables\n- Membership tests on potentially undefined variables\n\"\"\"\n\nimport re\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef lint_template(template_path: Path) -\u003e list[str]:\n    violations = []\n    content = template_path.read_text()\n    \n    # Check: pprint without strict_type\n    if '| pprint' in content and '| strict_type' not in content:\n        violations.append(\n            f\"{template_path}: Uses | pprint without | strict_type('type') validation\"\n        )\n    \n    # Check: 'key' in var pattern (membership test on potentially undefined)\n    pattern = r\"{%\\s*if\\s+'[^']+'\\s+in\\s+(\\w+)\\s*%}\"\n    for match in re.finditer(pattern, content):\n        var_name = match.group(1)\n        violations.append(\n            f\"{template_path}: Membership test 'key' in {var_name} may bypass Undefined tracking\"\n        )\n    \n    return violations\n```\n\n### 4. Update Template Best Practices\n\n**Document in `buttermilk/templates/README.md`** (already created):\n\n```markdown\n### REQUIRED: Type validation for dict/list variables\n\n❌ BAD - No type checking:\n{{ expected | pprint }}\n\n✅ GOOD - Explicit type validation:\n{{ expected | strict_type('dict') | pprint }}\n```\n\n## Test Coverage\n\nComprehensive tests already exist in `tests/integration/test_template_required_variables.py`:\n\n**Missing variable tests**:\n- Parametrized across 6 major templates\n- Tests each required variable is detected in `unfilled_vars`\n\n**Type mismatch tests**:\n- Tests dict-as-string scenarios\n- Tests list-as-string scenarios  \n- Validates templates reject or clearly error on wrong types\n\n**Currently**: 7 out of 12 tests **FAIL**, exposing the bugs.\n\n**After fix**: All 12 tests should **PASS**.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `KeepUndefinedAndCollect.__repr__()` override implemented\n- [ ] `strict_type` filter added and registered\n- [ ] All major templates updated to use `strict_type` for dict/list variables\n- [ ] Template linting script created\n- [ ] All 12 tests in `test_template_required_variables.py` pass\n- [ ] No production incidents from type mismatches in templates\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #75 - Find and delete mock code, fallbacks, defaults (fail-fast philosophy)\n- #222 - Adjust prompt templates (template improvements)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `buttermilk/utils/templating.py` - Add `__repr__` and `strict_type` filter\n- `buttermilk/templates/prompt/score.jinja2` - Add type validation\n- `buttermilk/templates/prompt/synthesise.jinja2` - Add type validation\n- `buttermilk/templates/prompt/rag.jinja2` - Add type validation\n- `buttermilk/templates/prompt/analyst.jinja2` - Add type validation\n- `buttermilk/templates/prompt/ra.jinja2` - Add type validation\n- `scripts/lint_templates.py` - New linting script\n\n## Test Output\n\nCurrent failure output demonstrates the severity:\n\n```\nFAILED tests/.../test_template_required_variables.py::test_score_template_expected_as_json_string_fails\nAssertionError: score template SILENTLY ACCEPTED JSON string instead of dict!\nThis is the EXACT bug from production:\n- BigQuery returns: '{\"reasons\": [\"Does not violate\"], \"violating\": false}'\n- Template expects: {\"reasons\": [\"Does not violate\"], \"violating\": False}\nunfilled_vars = set()\nTemplate must detect type mismatches!\n```\n\n## Priority\n\n**HIGH** - This is a data integrity issue that causes silent corruption of research data in production.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-22T03:08:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-22T10:04:06Z","closed_at":"2025-10-22T10:04:06Z"}

Don't load embedding model until first query\n2. Share model instance across queries (singleton pattern)\n3. Handle concurrent requests during model loading\n\n**Test Strategy**:\n- Test model loads on first query\n- Test subsequent queries reuse loaded model\n- Test concurrent queries wait for single load\n- Test model loading failures are handled gracefully\n\n**Expected Outcome**: Critical path: ~14s (saves 2s)\n\n**Files to modify**:\n- `buttermilk/agents/tools/chromadb_search.py` - Lazy model loading\n- `tests/integration/test_embedding_lazy_load.py` - New test file\n\n### Phase 4: ExecutionContext Background Initialization (Medium Risk)\n\n**Goal**: Move ExecutionContext background init completely off critical path\n\n**Changes**:\n1. Defer background tasks in ExecutionContext.__init__\n2. Start background tasks asynchronously\n3. Ensure observability remains intact\n4. Handle queries before background init completes\n\n**Test Strategy**:\n- Test ExecutionContext instantiates quickly\n- Test background tasks complete successfully\n- Test tracing/logging works before background init complete\n- Test no race conditions in background initialization\n\n**Expected Outcome**: Critical path: ~12s (saves 2s)\n\n**Files to modify**:\n- `buttermilk/_core/execution_context.py` - Defer background init\n- `tests/unit/test_execution_context.py` - Add lazy init tests\n\n**Risk Mitigation**:\n- Fail fast if observability setup fails (no defensive coding)\n- Clear error messages if accessed before ready\n- Comprehensive logging of initialization state\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Phase 1 Complete\n- [ ] Cloud logging starts locally and upgrades to cloud async\n- [ ] No logs are lost during transition\n- [ ] Startup time \u003c 40s\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests verify lazy cloud logging behavior\n\n### Phase 2 Complete\n- [ ] ChromaDB initializes in background\n- [ ] Startup time \u003c 20s on critical path\n- [ ] Queries work correctly after warmup\n- [ ] Graceful handling of queries before warmup\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests verify lazy ChromaDB initialization\n\n### Phase 3 Complete\n- [ ] Embedding model loads on first query\n- [ ] Startup time \u003c 15s on critical path\n- [ ] Model shared across queries\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests verify lazy model loading\n\n### Phase 4 Complete\n- [ ] ExecutionContext background init is fully async\n- [ ] Startup time \u003c 12s on critical path\n- [ ] Observability works correctly\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests verify lazy ExecutionContext init\n\n### Final Success\n- [ ] Total startup time \u003c 30s (MCP timeout requirement met)\n- [ ] All functionality works correctly with lazy initialization\n- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs\n- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all lazy initialization paths\n- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new initialization behavior\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Categories\n\n1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`)\n   -

{"id":"bm-198","title":"Redesign CLI for intuitive researcher experience with seamless config management","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nButtermilk has grown organically with two CLI interfaces that evolved independently:\n\n1. **Hydra CLI** (`buttermilk/runner/cli.py`) - The actual working interface, uses `@hydra.main`\n2. **Typer CLI** (`buttermilk/runner/batch_cli.py`) - Implemented but never integrated (no entry point)\n\n**Current researcher experience** (from TJA project):\n```bash\nuv run python -m buttermilk.runner.cli \\\n  --config-dir=../conf \\\n  run.limit=100 \\\n  run.flow=trans \\\n  job=batch \\\n  project_name=TJA\n```\n\n**Issues**:\n- Verbose, non-intuitive command structure\n- Config directory handling is awkward (`--config-dir=../conf`)\n- Hydra overrides syntax is unfamiliar to many researchers\n- No clear \"entry point\" command (using `python -m` module syntax)\n- Mode switching (batch vs console vs api) requires understanding run.mode internals\n- The simpler Typer CLI exists but was never integrated\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What Works\n✅ Hydra CLI handles all modes: console, batch, batch_run, batch_all, api, pipeline, slackbot\n✅ Composable YAML configuration (Hydra's strength)\n✅ Summary statistics now display for batch operations (#271)\n✅ Session-scoped BM for proper observability\n✅ Multiple flows can be configured and selected\n\n### What's Broken/Awkward\n❌ No intuitive entry point (`bm` command doesn't exist in pyproject.toml)\n❌ Config directory must be specified every time, relative paths awkward\n❌ Command syntax mixes Python module execution with Hydra overrides\n❌ Mode selection requires understanding config internals\n❌ Typer CLI created (#269) but orphaned (never integrated)\n❌ No auto-discovery of researcher's config directory\n❌ Help text doesn't reflect researcher mental model\n\n### Discovery: Typer CLI Never Integrated\n\nThe Typer CLI (`batch_cli.py`) implemented in #269:\n- Has clean syntax: `bm run batch \u003cflow\u003e [options]`\n- Auto-discovers storage from flow config\n- Has comprehensive tests (all passing)\n- **BUT** was never added to `pyproject.toml` entry points\n- **Result**: Researchers still use the verbose Hydra CLI\n\n## Vision: Researcher-Friendly CLI\n\n### Guiding Principles\n\n1. **Intuitive Commands**: Researchers think in terms of \"run a flow\" not \"execute Python module with Hydra overrides\"\n2. **Smart Defaults**: Auto-discover config directories, use sensible defaults\n3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple commands for common tasks, advanced options available when needed\n4. **Helpful Feedback**: Clear error messages, progress indicators, summaries\n5. **Config Composability**: Maintain Hydra's power for complex scenarios\n6. **Reproducibility**: All commands should be documentable and repeatable\n\n### Proposed User Experience\n\n**Ideal researcher workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Simple batch run (auto-discovers config from current dir or ../conf)\nbm batch trans\n\n# Limit processing\nbm batch trans --limit 100\n\n# Use specific config directory\nbm batch trans --config-dir /path/to/research/conf\n\n# Interactive console run\nbm console trans --record-id 12345\n\n# Start API server for web interface\nbm api\n\n# Run pipeline\nbm pipeline\n```\n\n**Advanced usage with Hydra overrides:**\n\n```bash\n# Override specific configs (Hydra composability)\nbm batch trans flows=trans llms=flash storage=custom\n\n# Multiple overrides\nbm batch trans run.limit=50 job=experiment_name\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (This PR)\n\n**Goal**: Make current Hydra CLI more accessible without breaking changes\n\n1. **Add `bm` entry point** to pyproject.toml\n   ```toml\n   [project.scripts]\n   bm = \"buttermilk.runner.cli:main\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Auto-discover config directory**\n   - Check current directory for `conf/` or `config/`\n   - Check parent directory for `../conf/`\n   - Check `~/.buttermilk/conf/`\n   - Allow override with `--config-dir`\n\n3. **Simplify mode selection**\n   - Current: `uv run python -m buttermilk.runner.cli job=batch run.mode=batch_all`\n   - Proposed: Add simple subcommands that set mode automatically\n   ```bash\n   bm batch \u003cflow\u003e      # Sets mode=batch_all\n   bm console \u003cflow\u003e    # Sets mode=console\n   bm api              # Sets mode=api\n   bm pipeline         # Sets mode=pipeline\n   ```\n\n4. **Improve help text and error messages**\n   - Add docstrings to main() explaining each mode\n   - Provide examples in `--help` output\n   - Clear error messages when config not found\n\n### Phase 2: CLI Redesign (Future)\n\n**Goal**: Restructure for optimal researcher experience\n\n1. **Decision: Hydra or Typer?**\n   - **Option A - Keep Hydra, enhance UX**: \n     - Maintain config composability\n     - Add convenience wrappers for common patterns\n     - Keep existing researcher configs working\n   \n   - **Option B - Migrate to Typer**: \n     - Cleaner CLI syntax\n     - Better auto-complete\n     - More intuitive for non-Python researchers\n     - **Challenge**: Preserve Hydra's config composition power\n   \n   - **Option C - Hybrid**: \n     - Typer CLI for common operations\n     - Falls back to Hydra for advanced config composition\n     - Best of both worlds, more complex to maintain\n\n2. **Config directory management**\n   - Project-local configs (`./conf/` or `../conf/`)\n   - User-global configs (`~/.buttermilk/conf/`)\n   - Explicit override (`--config-dir PATH`)\n   - Config inheritance and merging\n\n3. **Interactive mode improvements**\n   - Prompt for missing required parameters\n   - Config validation with helpful errors\n   - Dry-run mode to preview what will execute\n\n4. **Daemon mode**\n   - Background processing with status checks\n   - Process management (start, stop, status)\n   - Log tailing and monitoring\n\n### Phase 3: Integration with Config Redesign (#223)\n\n**Goal**: Align CLI with researcher-friendly config hierarchy\n\n- Infrastructure layer (set once per researcher)\n- Flow layer (what researchers create)\n- Runtime layer (execution modes)\n\nCLI should make it easy to:\n- Create new flows\n- Run existing flows with different parameters\n- Switch between infrastructure environments (dev/prod)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Immediate (This Issue)\n\n- [x] Add summary statistics to batch modes (#271) ✅ \n- [x] Remove orphaned Typer CLI\n- [ ] Add `bm` entry point to pyproject.toml\n- [ ] Implement config directory auto-discovery\n- [ ] Add subcommand helpers (batch, console, api, pipeline)\n- [ ] Improve help text and documentation\n- [ ] Update README with new simplified commands\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- [ ] Gather researcher feedback on proposed CLI syntax\n- [ ] Decide on Hydra vs Typer vs Hybrid approach\n- [ ] Design config directory precedence and merging\n- [ ] Prototype interactive mode features\n- [ ] Design daemon mode architecture\n- [ ] Align with config hierarchy redesign (#223)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Researcher can:**\n- ✅ Run batch processing with single intuitive command\n- ✅ Use their own config directory without complex paths\n- ✅ Get helpful error messages when something's wrong\n- ✅ See progress and summary statistics\n- ✅ Understand what the CLI will do before running (dry-run)\n- ✅ Document their workflow in reproducible commands\n- ✅ Switch between development and production configs easily\n\n**Research integrity maintained:**\n- ✅ All runs are traceable and logged\n- ✅ Configuration is explicit and versioned\n- ✅ Observability works correctly (session-scoped BM)\n- ✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #271 - Add summary statistics (✅ implemented)\n- #269 - Simplify batch CLI (orphaned Typer implementation)\n- #223 - Redesign configuration hierarchy\n- #221 - Session-centric observability\n\n## Call for Feedback\n\nThis issue aims to \"ultrathink about how to best provide researchers with an interface that is intuitive and works with their own configs seamlessly and flawlessly.\"\n\n**Questions for discussion:**\n1. Should we keep Hydra, switch to Typer, or use a hybrid approach?\n2. What config directory precedence makes sense for researchers?\n3. Should we prioritize backward compatibility or optimal UX?\n4. What CLI patterns do researchers find most intuitive?\n5. How should daemon mode work for long-running batch processing?\n\nFeedback welcome! 🧠","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:45:51Z","updated_at":"2025-10-31T05:49:05Z","closed_at":"2025-10-31T05:49:05Z","labels":["good first issue","help wanted","question"]}

{"id":"bm-201","title":"Migrate from Autogen to LiteLLM for all LLM API calls while maintaining backward compatibility with existing ExecutionTrace and observability infrastructure","description":"## Migrate from Autogen to LiteLLM for all LLM API calls while maintaining backward compatibility with existing ExecutionTrace and observability infrastructure\n\n## Current State\n\n**Dependencies:**\n - **Autogen** (`autogen-core`, `autogen-ext`): Currently handles all LLM API calls via `ChatCompletionClient`\n - **LiteLLM**: Only used for token cost calculation (`buttermilk/utils/pricing.py`)\n \n**Key Components:** \n- `buttermilk/_core/llms.py`: Manages LLM configurations and clients\n- `LLMConfig`: Stores provider config\n- `AutoGenWrapper`: Wraps Autogen's ChatCompletionClient\n- `LLMs`: Registry for LLM clients 2. `buttermilk/_core/llm_core.py`: Core LLM operations\n- `LLMCore`: Template rendering, calling, tracing\n- `LLMResult`: Result structure with metadata 3. `buttermilk/agents/llm.py`: Agent wrapper around LLMCore\n\n **Current Providers:**\n- OpenAI (direct and via Azure)\n- Anthropic (direct and via Vertex)\n- Google Gemini (via Vertex)\n- Vertex OpenAI endpoints (for Llama, etc.)\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Create LiteLLM Wrapper\n\n✅ **Goal:** Build a drop-in replacement for `AutoGenWrapper` using LiteLLM\n\n**Tasks:**\n\n- [ ] Create `LiteLLMWrapper` class in `buttermilk/_core/llms.py`\n- [ ] Implement `.create()` method matching `AutoGenWrapper` interface\n- [ ] Implement `.call_chat()` for tool execution flow\n- [ ] Convert between Autogen message types and LiteLLM format\n- [ ] Preserve retry logic (copy from `RetryWrapper`)\n- [ ] Maintain structured output parsing\n- [ ] Support tool calling/function execution\n- [ ] Integrate pricing calculation (already using LiteLLM)\n- [ ] Message format conversion utilities\n- [ ] `autogen_to_litellm_messages()`: Convert LLMMessage → LiteLLM format\n- [ ] `litellm_to_autogen_result()`: Convert LiteLLM response → CreateResult/ModelOutput\n- [ ] Handle tool calls in both directions\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- `LiteLLMWrapper` implements same interface as `AutoGenWrapper`\n- All message types convert correctly\n- Structured output parsing works identically\n- Tool calling flow matches existing behavior\n\n### Phase 2: Update Configuration ✅\n\n**Goal:** Allow per-model selection of wrapper type\n**Tasks:**\n\n- [ ] Add `use_litellm: bool` flag to `LLMConfig`\n- [ ] Update `LLMs.get_autogen_chat_client()` to:\n- [ ] Check `use_litellm` flag\n- [ ] Return `LiteLLMWrapper` when flag is True\n- [ ] Return `AutoGenWrapper` (existing) when flag is False\n- [ ] Default to False for backward compatibility\n- [ ] Simplify provider configuration for LiteLLM\n- [ ] Map `ClientType` enum to LiteLLM provider names\n- [ ] Leverage LiteLLM's built-in provider support\n- [ ] Reduce custom credential handling where possible\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Can toggle wrapper type per model via config\n- Both wrapper types work side-by-side\n- No breaking changes to existing configs\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation ✅\n\n**Goal:** Ensure full compatibility and correctness\n**Tasks:**\n\n- [ ] Unit tests for `LiteLLMWrapper`\n- [ ] Test basic completion calls\n- [ ] Test structured output with schemas\n- [ ] Test tool calling flow\n- [ ] Test retry logic\n- [ ] Test error handling\n- [ ] Test pricing calculation\n- [ ] Integration tests\n- [ ] Run existing LLM tests with both wrapper types\n- [ ] Verify ExecutionTrace metadata matches\n- [ ] Verify Weave tracing works correctly\n- [ ] Test all supported providers (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Gemini, Vertex)\n- [ ] End-to-end tests\n- [ ] Run existing flows with LiteLLM wrapper\n- [ ] Verify complete observability chain\n- [ ] Verify agent behavior unchanged\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- All existing tests pass with LiteLLM wrapper\n- ExecutionTrace metadata identical between wrappers\n- No observable behavioral differences\n\n### Phase 4: Gradual Migration ✅\n\n**Goal:** Migrate models one at a time\n**Tasks:**\n\n- [ ] Update `conf/models.json` to enable LiteLLM for specific models\n- [ ] Start with one low-risk model (e.g., `gemini25flash`)\n- [ ] Monitor production usage and observability\n- [ ] Gradually enable for more models\n- [ ] Document any provider-specific quirks\n **Acceptance Criteria:**\n- At least one production model using LiteLLM\n- Observability and tracing working correctly\n- No production incidents\n\n### Phase 5: Deprecation (Future) 🔮\n\n **Goal:** Eventually remove Autogen dependency\n **Tasks:**\n\n- [ ] Migrate all models to LiteLLM\n- [ ] Remove `AutoGenWrapper` class\n- [ ] Remove Autogen dependencies from `pyproject.toml`\n- [ ] Update documentation\n- [ ] Keep Autogen message types (widely used in codebase)\n\n## Benefits ✅\n\n**Provider flexibility**: LiteLLM supports 100+ providers natively ✅\n**Simplified configuration**: Uniform interface across all providers ✅\n**Better cost tracking**: Already using LiteLLM for pricing ✅\n**Gradual migration**: Test per-model without breaking existing flows ✅\n**Zero breaking changes**: Existing API stays fully intact ✅\n**Reduced custom code**: Less provider-specific credential handling ✅\n**Future-proof**: Easy to add new providers as they emerge\n\n## Non-Goals \n❌ Changing `ExecutionTrace` structure \n❌ Modifying `LLMCore` or `LLMAgent` interfaces \n❌ Breaking backward compatibility \n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] LiteLLM wrapper implemented with full feature parity\n- [ ] All tests pass with both wrapper types\n- [ ] At least one production model using LiteLLM successfully\n- [ ] Observability and tracing fully functional\n- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing code\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-01T10:47:05Z","updated_at":"2025-12-24T17:28:26Z","closed_at":"2025-12-24T17:28:26Z","labels":["bots"]}

ExecutionTrace Objects Not in Log Files\n- Log files (`/tmp/bm_buttermilk_exec-*.jsonl`) contain only debug/info messages\n- NO `agent_info` fields found in logs\n- NO ExecutionTrace data structures in logs\n- NO `messages` arrays in logs\n- ExecutionTrace objects only sent via callbacks, not written to logs\n\n### 2. Message Structure from Fixtures\nFrom `tests/integration/fixtures/tja_judge_trace_minneapolis_shooting.json`:\n- `messages` field exists on ExecutionTrace\n- `messages[0]` is a **JSON string** (not object)\n- Must parse with `json.loads(trace[\"messages\"][0])` to get dict\n- After parsing, `content` field contains the instruction text\n\nExample from `tests/unit/test_template_empty_expected.py` line 57:\n```python\ninstructions=json.loads(judge_trace[\"messages\"][0])[\"content\"]\n```\n\n### 3. JMESPath Extraction Path\nCurrent path: `\"[JUDGE,SYNTHESISER].messages[0].content\"`\n\nThis assumes:\n- Scorers receive ExecutionTrace objects from JUDGE/SYNTHESISER as context\n- Those traces have `messages` arrays\n- Messages are already parsed objects (not JSON strings)\n\n**Unclear**:\n- How does scorer receive context from previous agents?\n- Is context passed through orchestrator's message passing?\n- What actual data structure does scorer see in its inputs?\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n1. ✅ Fixed `source` parameter mapping (user renamed variable)\n2. ✅ Added `.content` accessor to path: `\"[JUDGE,SYNTHESISER].messages[0].content\"`\n3. ❌ Still fails - instructions not extracted\n\n## What Needs Investigation\n\n### Priority 1: Understand Scorer Context Mechanism\n**Questions**:\n1. How do observer agents (scorers have `observer: true`) receive context from previous agents?\n2. What data structure is passed to scorers in the `inputs` parameter?\n3. Is the JMESPath extraction applied to ExecutionTrace objects or a different structure?\n\n**Files to check**:\n- Orchestrator code for observer context passing\n- `buttermilk/agents/evaluators/scorer.py` (scorer implementation)\n- Input extraction/mapping code (where JMESPath is applied)\n\n### Priority 2: Parse Actual Scorer Input Structure\n**Action**: Examine `tests/fixtures/rescore_trace_0199e62b.json` (40K tokens)\n- Contains real scorer trace data from production\n- Shows actual input structure scorers receive\n- Compare paths in config to actual structure\n\n**Key questions**:\n- Are `messages` JSON strings or objects in scorer inputs?\n- Is the path correct for the actual structure?\n- Does extraction happen before or after JSON parsing?\n\n### Priority 3: Fix Test Message Collection\n**Problem**: E2E test callback receives 0 messages despite flow running 62s\n- Flow completes successfully (status: \"completed\")\n- But `callback_to_ui` never invoked or messages not collected\n\n**Check**:\n- Does FlowRunner actually call the callback?\n- Are ExecutionTrace messages sent via callback during flow execution?\n- Is message collection pattern correct?\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```bash\n# Run E2E test\nuv run pytest tests/endtoend/flows/test_flow_e2e.py::test_flow_execution_e2e -xvs\n\n# Observe:\n# - Test fails with 0 messages collected\n# - Log shows scorer template errors\n# - Flow runs for ~60s but test gets no callbacks\n```\n\n## Related Files\n\n**Configuration**:\n- `buttermilk/conf/agents/scorer.yaml` - Scorer config with input mappings\n- `buttermilk/templates/prompt/score.jinja2` - Template expecting `instructions` variable\n\n**Tests**:\n- `tests/endtoend/flows/test_flow_e2e.py` - E2E test for trans flow\n- `tests/agents/test_jmespath_extract.py` - JMESPath extraction tests (passes)\n- `tests/unit/test_template_empty_expected.py` - Template filling tests with fixtures\n\n**Test Data**:\n- `tests/fixtures/rescore_trace_0199e62b.json` - Real scorer input data (need to examine)\n- `tests/integration/fixtures/tja_judge_trace_minneapolis_shooting.json` - Judge trace with messages\n\n**Code**:\n- `buttermilk/agents/evaluators/scorer.py` - LLMScorer implementation\n- `buttermilk/orchestrators/groupchat.py` - Orchestrator (context passing?)\n- `buttermilk/_core/contract.py` - ExecutionTrace definition (lines 500+, 557-559)\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n1. JUDGE and SYNTHESISER agents execute and produce ExecutionTrace objects with `messages` arrays\n2. Scorer receives these traces as context through orchestrator\n3.

{"id":"bm-211","title":"RFC: Unified Processor Architecture - Merge Pipeline/Batch/Flow into Single Abstraction","description":"## Summary\n\nUnify the current fragmented architecture (pipelines, batch mode, flows, orchestrators) into a single composable abstraction where **everything is a Processor**.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrent architecture has multiple overlapping concepts:\n\n| Concept | Config | Expansion | Coordinator |\n|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| Flow/Groupchat | `FlowConfig` + `AgentVariants` | `variants` dict → N parallel agents | `Orchestrator` |\n| Pipeline | `PipelineConfig` + `ProcessorVariants` | `variants` dict → N parallel processors | `PipelineOrchestrator` |\n| Batch mode | CLI expands `flow.parameters` externally | Manual `expand_dict()` loop | Wraps flow in `OrchestratorProcessor` |\n\n**Problems:**\n1. `batch` mode in CLI manually loops over `expand_dict(flow.parameters)` - duplicates pipeline's internal variant expansion\n2. `OrchestratorProcessor` is a wrapper to make flows fit the processor interface - shouldn't be needed\n3. Two different config models for essentially the same pattern\n4. \"Session\" concept is unclear\n5. No unified way to compose ML models, groupchats, and simple transformers\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### Core Principle: Everything is a Processor\n\n```python\nclass Processor(Protocol):\n    \"\"\"Single-record processor.\"\"\"\n    async def process(\n        self, record: BaseRecord, ctx: ProcessingContext\n    ) -\u003e AsyncGenerator[BaseRecord, None]: ...\n\nclass BatchProcessor(Protocol):\n    \"\"\"Batch processor for GPU efficiency.\"\"\"\n    batch_size: int\n    \n    async def process_batch(\n        self, records: list[BaseRecord], ctx: ProcessingContext\n    ) -\u003e AsyncGenerator[BaseRecord, None]: ...\n```\n\n### Everything becomes a processor:\n\n| Thing | As Processor |\n|-------|--------------|\n| Variant expander | Yields N records (one per parameter combo) |\n| Groupchat | Yields 1 record (after internal agent orchestration) |\n| Simple transformer | Yields 1 record (transformed) |\n| Filter | Yields 0 or 1 records |\n| ML model | BatchProcessor - receives batches for GPU efficiency |\n| Save/Upload | Processor that writes and yields record unchanged |\n\n### ProcessingContext (single state carrier)\n\n```python\nclass ProcessingContext:\n    \"\"\"All state flows through this.\"\"\"\n    bm: BM                           # Session resources\n    data: dict[str, Any]             # Accumulated context from prior processors\n    traces: list[ExecutionTrace]     # Trace sink (append-only)\n    ui_callback: Callable | None     # For interactive components (websocket)\n    otel_span: Span | None           # OTEL context\n```\n\n**Key insight**: `ui_callback` solves the websocket/interactive problem. Groupchat processor calls `ctx.ui_callback(message)` when it needs human input.

The record carries its identity (`record_id`) and parameters (in `metadata`). Traces capture lineage.\n\nMultiple copies of the same source record (from expander) are distinguishable by their metadata.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Core Abstractions\n- [ ] Define `Processor` protocol in `buttermilk/_core/processor.py`\n- [ ] Define `BatchProcessor` protocol\n- [ ] Define `ProcessingContext` model\n- [ ] Create base `ProcessorConfig` and subclasses\n\n### Phase 2: Migrate Existing Processors\n- [ ] Update existing processors to implement new protocol\n- [ ] Create `GroupchatProcessor` that wraps current `Orchestrator`\n- [ ] Create `ExpanderProcessor` for variant expansion\n- [ ] Verify ML/toxicity processors work with `BatchProcessor`\n\n### Phase 3: Unified Executor\n- [ ] Create new `PipelineExecutor` that handles both protocols\n- [ ] Implement lifetime management (per-record vs reusable)\n- [ ] Implement batching logic for `BatchProcessor`\n- [ ] Wire up `ui_callback` for interactive components\n\n### Phase 4: Config Migration\n- [ ] Create new `PipelineConfig` model\n- [ ] Write config migration for existing flow configs\n- [ ] Update CLI to use single \"pipeline\" mode\n- [ ] Remove deprecated `FlowConfig`, `FlowRunner`\n\n### Phase 5: Cleanup\n- [ ] Remove `OrchestratorProcessor` wrapper\n- [ ] Remove batch mode special handling in CLI\n- [ ] Update documentation\n- [ ] Update tests\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Why not adopt an existing library (Ray Data, LangGraph, etc.)?**\n   - No library handles the hybrid ML + groupchat + interactive pattern\n   - Core abstraction is ~150 lines - simpler to own than fight framework assumptions\n   - Can swap in Ray Data as executor backend later if GPU batching becomes bottleneck\n\n2. **Why subclass configs instead of string `type` field?**\n   - Type safety with discriminated unions\n   - IDE autocomplete\n   - Pydantic validation per type\n\n3. **Why parameters in record.metadata instead of context?**\n   - Each record carries its own parameters\n   - No global state\n   - Traces naturally capture which parameters were used\n   - Expander can be anywhere in pipeline\n\n4. **Why dual protocols (Processor + BatchProcessor)?**\n   - GPU workloads need batching for efficiency\n   - Executor handles the difference transparently\n   - Processors stay composable regardless of batching needs\n\n## References\n\n- Recent commit removing sequential tasks: `0a0788c1`\n- Current `PipelineOrchestrator`: `buttermilk/pipeline.py`\n- Current `Orchestrator`: `buttermilk/_core/orchestrator.py`\n- Current `OrchestratorProcessor`: `buttermilk/processors/orchestrator_processor.py`\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-20T20:46:45Z","updated_at":"2025-12-23T03:06:29Z","closed_at":"2025-12-23T03:06:29Z","labels":["architecture"]}

{"id":"bm-214","title":"RFC: BatchPipelineRunner Architecture for Async Batch Processing","description":"## Summary\n\nDesign a `BatchPipelineRunner` that separates batch processing from streaming pipelines, enabling support for:\n- Vertex AI async batch jobs (hours to days)\n- Local GPU batch inference\n- Future pub/sub worker architecture\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current `PipelineOrchestrator` uses a streaming model where each record flows through the entire processor chain independently. This breaks when combined with `BatchAccumulator`:\n\n1. Pipeline creates independent `asyncio.Task` per record\n2. Each task expects `processor.process()` to yield outputs immediately\n3. `BatchAccumulator` buffers records and only yields when batch is full\n4. First N-1 records get `RecordSkippedException` (empty output = \"filtered\")\n5. Only the Nth record yields all results, but they're attributed to wrong tasks\n\nThis is a fundamental architectural mismatch - streaming and batching are different paradigms.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      BatchPipelineRunner                             │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                      │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐  │\n│  │    Source    │───►│  Expanders   │───►│   BatchExecutor      │  │\n│  │  (records)   │    │  (sync 1:N)  │    │   (pluggable)        │  │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘  │\n│                                                   │                  │\n│                                                   ▼                  │\n│                                          ┌──────────────┐           │\n│                                          │   Results    │           │\n│                                          │  (BigQuery)  │           │\n│                                          └──────────────┘           │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nBatchExecutor implementations:\n├── SyncBatchExecutor      ← process_batch() runs inline\n├── AsyncVertexExecutor    ← submit job, poll, retrieve results  \n├── LocalGPUExecutor       ← future: batch to local GPU\n└── PubSubExecutor         ← future: publish to queue, workers process\n```\n\n### Key Interface\n\n```python\nclass BatchPipelineRunner(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Run batch processing pipelines.\n    \n    Unlike streaming PipelineOrchestrator, this runner:\n    -

{"id":"bm-49","title":"Configuration Architecture: Type-specific Storage Config Schema","description":"# Configuration Architecture Issue: Storage Config Schema Design\n\n## Issue Description\n\n**Parent Issue**: #74 (Phase 3: Remaining Implementation Tasks)\n\nThe current `StorageConfig`/`DataSourceConfig` architecture has a fundamental design problem that violates our HASS-centric design principles and creates poor user experience.\n\n## Current Problem\n\n### Symptoms\n- **46 validation errors** when starting API daemon\n- All storage types forced to have identical required fields regardless of relevance\n- Configuration becomes confusing and error-prone for researchers\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nRecent changes moved hardcoded defaults to a unified config schema, but applied a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach:\n\n```yaml\n# These fields are now REQUIRED for ALL storage types:\nmax_records_per_group: -1    # Relevant for: BigQuery, File systems\nglob: \"**/*\"                 # Relevant for: File systems only  \nlast_n_days: 7              # Relevant for: Time-series data only\nsplit: train                # Relevant for: ML datasets only\ndimensionality: -1          # Relevant for: Vector stores only\n```\n\n### Examples of Poor Design\n1. **ChromaDB vector store** forced to specify `glob` patterns (file system concept)\n2. **File storage** forced to specify `dimensionality` (vector concept) \n3. **BigQuery** forced to specify `last_n_days` (time-series concept)\n4. **All agents** forced to specify `name_components` regardless of type\n\n## Impact on Project Goals\n\nThis violates multiple core principles from `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n### ❌ HASS-Centric Design\n- **Usability**: Researchers must configure irrelevant fields\n- **Clarity**: Configuration purpose becomes unclear\n- **Accessibility**: Increased cognitive load and error rate\n\n### ❌ Modularity  \n- Tight coupling between unrelated storage concepts\n- Difficult to extend with new storage types\n\n### ❌ Composable Configuration\n- Cannot compose sensible defaults per storage type\n- Forces global defaults that don't fit all use cases\n\n## Proposed Solution Architecture\n\n### 1. Type-Specific Storage Schemas\n\nCreate specialized config classes for each storage type:\n\n```python\nclass FileStorageConfig(StorageConfig):\n    type: Literal[\"file\"] \n    glob: str = \"**/*\"\n    max_records_per_group: int = -1\n    # No dimensionality field - not relevant\n\nclass VectorStorageConfig(StorageConfig):\n    type: Literal[\"chromadb\", \"pinecone\", \"weaviate\"]\n    dimensionality: int = -1\n    embedding_model: str\n    # No glob field - not relevant\n\nclass BigQueryStorageConfig(StorageConfig):\n    type: Literal[\"bigquery\"]\n    project_id: str\n    dataset_name: str  \n    # No glob or dimensionality - not relevant\n\nclass TimeSeriesStorageConfig(StorageConfig):\n    type: Literal[\"timeseries\"]\n    last_n_days: int = 7\n    # Time-specific fields only\n```\n\n### 2. Discriminated Union Pattern\n\nUse Pydantic's discriminated unions for type-safe configuration:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Union\nfrom pydantic import Field, discriminator\n\nStorageConfigUnion = Annotated[\n    Union[FileStorageConfig, VectorStorageConfig, BigQueryStorageConfig, TimeSeriesStorageConfig],\n    Field(discriminator='type')\n]\n```\n\n### 3. Composable Hydra Defaults\n\nOrganize defaults by storage type:\n\n```\nconf/\n├── defaults/\n│   ├── storage/\n│   │   ├── file.yaml          # File-specific defaults\n│   │   ├── vector.yaml        # Vector-specific defaults  \n│   │   ├── bigquery.yaml      # BigQuery-specific defaults\n│   │   └── timeseries.yaml    # Time-series defaults\n│   └── agents/\n│       ├── rag.yaml           # RAG agent defaults\n│       └── analysis.yaml      # Analysis agent defaults\n```\n\n### 4. Agent-Specific Configuration\n\nSimilar approach for agents - each agent type has relevant fields only:\n\n```python\nclass RagAgentConfig(AgentConfig):\n    type: Literal[\"rag\"]\n    search_strategies: list[str] \n    max_search_rounds: int = 3\n    \nclass AnalysisAgentConfig(AgentConfig):\n    type: Literal[\"analysis\"] \n    analysis_depth: str = \"standard\"\n    # Different fields for different purposes\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Design \u0026 Validation\n1. **Design type-specific schemas** that capture actual usage patterns\n2. **Create migration strategy** for existing configurations  \n3. **Validate approach** with sample configurations\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation\n1. **Implement discriminated union pattern** for storage configs\n2. **Create specialized config classes** for each storage type\n3. **Update Hydra defaults structure** to be type-specific\n4. **Add validation logic** that enforces type-appropriate fields\n\n### Phase 3: Migration \u0026 Testing  \n1. **Migrate existing config files** to new schema\n2. **Update documentation** to reflect new approach\n3. **Add comprehensive tests** for each config type\n4. **Validate against all existing flows**\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Technical\n- ✅ Zero validation errors for correctly configured storage types\n- ✅ New storage types can be added without affecting existing ones\n- ✅ Configuration files only contain relevant fields\n\n### User Experience  \n- ✅ HASS researchers can configure storage without irrelevant fields\n- ✅ Clear error messages for misconfiguration\n- ✅ Self-documenting configuration structure\n\n### Maintainability\n- ✅ Type-safe configuration at compile time\n- ✅ Easy to extend with new storage/agent types\n- ✅ Composable defaults that make sense\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n\n- **Design \u0026 Validation**: 2-3 days\n- **Implementation**: 1 week  \n- **Migration \u0026 Testing**: 2-3 days\n- **Total**: ~1.5 weeks\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Low Risk\n- Well-established patterns (discriminated unions, type-specific schemas)\n- Incremental migration possible\n- Backward compatibility can be maintained during transition\n\n### Mitigation\n- Comprehensive test coverage during migration\n- Gradual rollout with validation at each step\n- Clear documentation for configuration changes\n\nThis architectural fix is essential for achieving our Phase 3 goals of production readiness and HASS-researcher usability.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-06-18T05:55:28Z","updated_at":"2025-08-08T08:42:12Z","closed_at":"2025-08-08T08:42:12Z"}

{"id":"bm-51","title":"Runtime Issue Debugging \u0026 Validation Strategy","description":"# Runtime Issue Debugging \u0026 Validation Strategy\n\n## Overview\n\nNow that configuration validation issues are resolved (Issue #76), we need a systematic approach to debug and validate runtime execution quality. This addresses the \"Enhanced RAG agent error\" and other runtime issues discovered during end-to-end testing.\n\n## Philosophy: Systematic Runtime Debugging\n\n**Configuration issues are solved** → Now focus on **runtime execution quality**\n- **Component isolation** before full flow testing\n- **Progressive complexity** from simple to full multi-agent flows\n- **Performance profiling** to identify bottlenecks\n- **Error categorization** to prioritize fixes\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Enhanced Log Analysis Infrastructure\n\n### 1.1 GCP Log Analyzer (Extends Issue #77)\n```bash\n# Real-time error tracking\nbuttermilk debug analyze-logs --follow --filter \"Enhanced RAG agent error\"\nbuttermilk debug analyze-logs --since 1h --error-patterns \"timeout|subscript|isinstance\"\n\n# Performance analysis  \nbuttermilk debug analyze-logs --performance --flow osb --since 30m\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Extend existing `buttermilk/debug/gcp_logs.py` with error pattern matching\n- Add real-time log streaming with structured error classification\n- Performance timing extraction from GCP logs\n\n### 1.2 Structured Error Classification\nCreate error taxonomy for systematic debugging:\n\n- **Type A**: Configuration/validation errors (✅ solved)\n- **Type B**: Python runtime errors (isinstance, import issues)\n- **Type C**: Agent execution timeouts/performance\n- **Type D**: LLM connectivity/response issues\n- **Type E**: Vector store connectivity issues\n\n**Implementation:**\n```python\n# buttermilk/debug/error_classifier.py\nclass RuntimeErrorClassifier:\n    def

Needed:**\n- Replace `isinstance(x, list[str])` with `isinstance(x, list)`\n- Replace `isinstance(x, dict[str, Any])` with `isinstance(x, dict)`\n- Add runtime type validation without subscripted generics\n\n### 3.2 Search Pipeline Profiling\n- **Query analysis timing** (LLM call #1)\n- **Vector search execution** (ChromaDB performance)\n- **Result synthesis timing** (LLM call #2)\n- **Memory usage patterns** during multi-field search\n\n**Implementation:**\n```python\n# buttermilk/debug/search_profiler.py\nclass SearchPipelineProfiler:\n    async def profile_query_analysis(self, query: str) -\u003e TimingReport\n    async def profile_vector_search(self, query: str) -\u003e SearchReport\n    async def profile_result_synthesis(self, results: list) -\u003e SynthesisReport\n```\n\n### 3.3 LLM Integration Validation\n- **Mock vs Real LLM** performance comparison\n- **Model switching** (test different models for planning vs synthesis)\n- **Timeout handling** and graceful degradation\n- **Token usage optimization**\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Flow Orchestration Debugging\n\n### 4.1 Message Flow Analysis\n```python\n# Trace message types through the system\nbuttermilk debug

Production Deployment Validation\n- **Blue-green deployment** testing with runtime validation\n- **Canary releases** with automated rollback on runtime errors\n- **A/B testing** for performance optimizations\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n### High Priority (Immediate)\n1. **Fix Enhanced RAG agent type checking** (quick win)\n   - Scan for `isinstance` with subscripted generics\n   - Replace with non-subscripted versions\n   - Add runtime type validation tests\n\n2. **Component isolation testing** (identify root causes)\n   - Build mock framework for dependencies\n   - Test each agent component individually\n   - Identify specific failure points\n\n3. **Basic performance profiling** (understand bottlenecks)\n   - Add timing instrumentation to key paths\n   - Identify slow components\n   - Create performance baseline\n\n### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)\n4. **GCP log analysis integration** (systematic error tracking)\n   - Real-time error pattern detection\n   - Performance metric extraction\n   - Error classification system\n\n5. **Flow orchestration debugging** (end-to-end reliability)\n   - Message flow tracing\n   - Session state validation\n   - Multi-agent coordination analysis\n\n6. **Health check accuracy fixes** (production readiness)\n   - Fix \"unhealthy\" status reporting\n   - Implement proper health checks\n   - Add component-specific health monitoring\n\n### Low Priority (Future)\n7. **Automated runtime test suite** (CI/CD integration)\n   - Comprehensive regression testing\n   - Performance benchmarking\n   - Automated quality gates\n\n8. **Production monitoring** (ongoing operations)\n   - Real-time dashboards\n   - Alerting and escalation\n   - Performance optimization guidance\n\n9. **Performance optimization** (scale improvements)\n   - Caching strategies\n   - Connection pooling\n   - Resource optimization\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### Debugging Strategy\n- **Isolate then integrate**: Test components individually before full flows\n- **Measure then optimize**: Profile before making performance changes\n- **Reproduce then fix**: Create reliable reproduction cases\n\n### Validation Approach\n- **Comprehensive coverage**: Test happy path, edge cases, and failure modes\n- **Realistic scenarios**: Use actual OSB queries and realistic workloads\n- **Production parity**: Test with production-like data and configurations\n\n### Monitoring Philosophy\n- **Proactive detection**: Catch issues before they impact users\n- **Actionable metrics**: Focus on metrics that drive specific actions\n- **Continuous improvement**: Use monitoring data to guide optimizations\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Technical Metrics\n- ✅ Zero Python runtime errors (isinstance, import issues)\n- ✅ \u003c5s response time for 95% of OSB queries\n- ✅ \u003e99% success rate for agent interactions\n- ✅ \u003c2s startup time for individual agents\n\n### User Experience Metrics\n- ✅ Reliable multi-agent conversations\n- ✅ Accurate health status reporting\n- ✅ Graceful degradation on errors\n- ✅ Consistent performance under load\n\n### Operational Metrics\n- ✅ Automated error detection and classification\n- ✅ Performance regression detection\n- ✅ Production deployment confidence\n- ✅ Reduced time-to-resolution for issues\n\nThis systematic approach will **methodically eliminate runtime issues** while building robust production monitoring capabilities, ensuring the OSB flow (and all buttermilk flows) operate reliably at scale.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-06-18T08:31:43Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:02:10.907373544+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T21:02:10.907373544+10:00","close_reason":"Stale

{"id":"bm-52","title":"Storage Config Validation: Field Validator Not Executing in Orchestrator","description":"# Storage Config Validation Issue Summary\n\n## Current Status\nWe have been working to fix the error:\n```\nConfig must be a BaseStorageConfig or OmegaConf DictConfig, got \u003cclass 'buttermilk._core.config.DataSourceConfig'\u003e\n```\n\n## What We've Done\n1. ✅ **Migrated from DataSourceConfig to BaseStorageConfig architecture**\n   - Updated AgentConfig and ToolConfig to use BaseStorageConfig with automatic conversion\n   - Added field validators to convert YAML dictionaries to proper storage config objects\n   - Updated ChromaDBEmbeddings to inherit from VectorStorageConfig instead of DataSourceConfig\n\n2. ✅ **Fixed storage config validation using discriminated unions**\n   - Modified StorageFactory.create_config() to use Pydantic's discriminated union with TypeAdapter\n   - This properly routes validation to correct subclasses (FileStorageConfig, BigQueryStorageConfig, etc.)\n   - Added missing fields like split_type to BigQueryStorageConfig\n\n3. ✅ **Fixed circular import issues**\n   - Made all problematic imports conditional (openai, anthropic, autogen_core, weave, etc.)\n   - This enables direct testing of storage config functionality\n\n4. ✅ **Updated CLI validation pipeline**\n   - Modified cli.py to include flows in FlowRunner.model_validate() call\n   - Added field validator to FlowRunner.validate_flows() to convert OmegaConf to Orchestrator instances\n\n## Current Problem\n**The field validator in Orchestrator is not running correctly during Pydantic validation.**\n\n### Evidence\n- ✅ StorageFactory.create_config() works perfectly in isolation\n- ✅ Discriminated union correctly creates FileStorageConfig and BigQueryStorageConfig objects\n- ❌ When Orchestrator.model_validate() runs, the storage field validator doesn't convert dictionaries\n\n### Root Cause\nThe field validator `Orchestrator.validate_storage_configs()` is not being called during model validation, so:\n1. YAML dictionaries remain as raw dicts\n2. Pydantic tries to validate them against BaseStorageConfig with `extra=\"forbid\"`  \n3. Subclass-specific fields like `path`, `index`, `project_id` are rejected\n\n### Test Results\n```bash\nTesting discriminated union directly...\n✓ file config created as FileStorageConfig      # StorageFactory works\n✓ bigquery config created as BigQueryStorageConfig\n\nTesting file storage validation...\n✗ storage.tja.path: Extra inputs are not permitted    # Orchestrator validation fails\n✗ storage.tja.index: Extra inputs are not permitted\n\nTesting BigQuery storage validation...  \n✗ storage.tox_train.project_id: Extra inputs are not permitted   # Orchestrator validation fails\n✗ storage.tox_train.dataset_id: Extra inputs are not permitted\n```\n\n## Next Steps to Fix\n\n### Option 1: Debug Field Validator Execution\n- Investigate why `@field_validator(\"storage\", mode=\"after\")` is not being called\n- Check validator precedence and execution order\n- Ensure the validator is properly registered\n\n### Option 2: Alternative Validation Approach  \n- Use `@model_validator(mode=\"before\")` instead of field validator\n- Apply conversion at the model level before field validation\n- This might have better execution guarantees\n\n### Option 3: Change BaseStorageConfig Validation\n- Change `extra=\"forbid\"` to `extra=\"allow\"` in BaseStorageConfig\n- **Warning**: This violates the principle of not making superficial fixes\n- Should only be considered if the validator approach can't be made to work\n\n## Files Modified\n- `buttermilk/_core/config.py` - AgentConfig/ToolConfig validation  \n- `buttermilk/_core/storage_config.py` - Discriminated union approach\n- `buttermilk/_core/orchestrator.py` - Storage field validator (NOT WORKING)\n- `buttermilk/runner/cli.py` - Flow validation pipeline\n- `buttermilk/runner/flowrunner.py` - FlowRunner validation\n- Multiple files - Conditional imports to enable testing\n\n## Key Insight\nThe architectural approach is correct - we just need to ensure the field validator actually executes during Pydantic model validation. The discriminated union and storage factory work perfectly when called directly.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-06-18T10:57:55Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T15:38:59Z","closed_at":"2025-06-19T15:38:59Z"}

Fast Fail Validation (High Priority)\n- Validate logger config during BM initialization (in `_post_init_setup`)\n- Fail immediately if configuration is invalid\n- Move validation from `setup_logging()` to initialization\n\n### 2. Better Error Messages (High Priority)  \n- Distinguish between 'config missing field' vs 'cloud service unavailable'\n- Provide actionable error messages\n- Include specific error details from cloud service\n\n### 3.

Move validation from `setup_logging()` to `_post_init_setup()`\n2. Add comprehensive config validation during BM initialization\n3. Fail fast with clear error messages\n\n### Phase 2: Improved Error Handling\n1. Separate validation errors from service availability errors\n2. Improve error messages to be actionable\n3. Add proper fallback logging with clear indication\n\n### Phase 3: Configuration Options\n1. Add `require_cloud_logging` option to fail rather than fallback\n2.

{"id":"bm-55","title":"RESOLVED: Smart cloud provider configuration validation implementation","description":"## Summary\n\nSuccessfully implemented a smart approach to cloud provider configuration validation that addresses the original problem without creating regressions.\n\n## Problem Solved\n\nThe OSB flow was showing misleading \"Logger config missing 'project' attribute\" warning when the real issue was that logger configurations need both 'project' and 'location' fields for GCP.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstead of using a discriminated union approach (which would be complex due to multiple cloud providers sharing the same type), we implemented a **context-aware validation pattern**:\n\n### 1. Base CloudProviderCfg Class\n- Flexible, generic configuration for all cloud providers\n- Uses `extra=\"allow\"` to handle provider-specific fields\n- No validation - allows any combination of fields\n\n### 2. Specialized LoggerConfig Class  \n- Extends CloudProviderCfg with strict validation\n- Only used for logger configurations via the `logger_cfg` field in BM\n- Validates that GCP logger configs have both 'project' and 'location'\n\n### 3. Context-Specific Usage\n```python\nclass BM(BaseModel):\n    # Generic cloud configs - no validation\n    clouds: list[CloudProviderCfg] = []\n    secret_provider: CloudProviderCfg | None = None\n    pubsub: CloudProviderCfg | None = None\n    \n    # Logger-specific config - strict validation\n    logger_cfg: LoggerConfig | None = None\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing configurations continue to work  \n✅ **Context-Aware**: Only validates when context requires it  \n✅ **Better Error Messages**: Clear, specific validation errors for logger configs  \n✅ **Fast-Fail**: Validation happens at model creation, not at runtime  \n✅ **HASS-Friendly**: Clear error messages help researchers fix config issues  \n\n## Testing Results\n\nAll configurations in `conf/local.yaml` validate correctly:\n- `clouds[0]` (gcp): ✅ Works without location  \n- `clouds[1]` (vertex): ✅ Works with location  \n- `secret_provider` (gcp): ✅ Works without location  \n- `pubsub` (gcp): ✅ Works without location  \n- `logger_cfg` (gcp): ✅ Requires both project and location  \n\n## Implementation Files\n\n- `buttermilk/_core/config.py`: Added LoggerConfig class with validation\n- `buttermilk/_core/bm_init.py`: Uses LoggerConfig for logger_cfg field\n- `tests/00initial/test_logging.py`: All tests passing\n\nThis approach provides the \"smarter way to deal with cloud configs\" requested while maintaining backward compatibility and providing excellent user experience for HASS researchers.\n\nCloses #80 #81","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-06-18T15:13:29Z","updated_at":"2025-08-23T23:59:53Z","closed_at":"2025-08-23T23:59:53Z"}
{"id":"bm-56","title":"MCP route and structured output llm tool definitions","description":"Flows are a series of interactions between Agents. Most flows are conducted by a HOST Agent that directs questions towards an appropriate agent using an `AgentInput` or `StepRequest` object. Agents, including hosts, can also run tools that are configured for the particular agent. Currently, HOST agents are provided a list of other agents in natural language, and the LLM responds in a structured format (eg `CallOnAgent`) with information that allows the python host module to eventually yield a StepRequest.\n\nAll of this is a bit complicated. Let's make a careful plan to make a cleaner and simpler control flow sequence so that:\n\n- [ ] Each agent has a description and input variables. Now that most LLMs can handle structured inputs, let's not rely on natural language for hosts to invoke other agents. I don't know what the best way to do it is, but perhaps we just allow each Agent to generate its own tool definition that we pass on to the Host.\n- [ ] The same tool definition should provide the necessary information to dynamically make a MCP route available to make a single request from an agent. Maybe we should create a MCP run-mode that runs a separate server daemon  for MCP routes only?\n- [ ] Lets see how much code we can save by doing away with across multiple host agents by just wrapping a tool call in an AgentInput/ToolInput and/or StepRequest object. \n\nI'm not sure what the best approach is, but read /CLAUDE.md and come up with a plan that best meets our goals.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-06-18T16:27:52Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T22:19:48Z","closed_at":"2025-06-18T22:19:48Z"}

{"id":"bm-67","title":"Radical simplification of LLMAgent and structured llm host agent tool calling","description":"We are building a groupchat of LLM agents using Autogen as the orchestration framework. Our custom LLM agent classes should be SIMPLE, but our code has become unworkably complicated. We need to THINK HARDER and CAREFULLY make a plan to radically simplify:\n* LLM agents should all inherit from the LLMAgent class. A LLMAgent has a main _process() method that takes an AgentInput and returns an AgentOutput. Our code constructs a prompt from jinja templates, configured variables, and agent state. Nice and simple.\n* LLMAgent instances can use tools if they are configured to do so. Tools are provided to the LLM as lists of FunctionTool objects (from autogen). \n* LLMs are accessed through an AutoGenWrapper object in llms.py, which wraps ChatCompletionClient from autogen. The wrapper's methods pass tool definitions to the autogen client and the wrapper handles tool calling when the agent returns a tool call.\n* LLMAgent instances can ALSO BE USED AS TOOLS. An example is the Fetch agent in fetch.py, which provides a tool definition for itself in the superclass's get_functions() method, in autogen's tool format.\n* Groupchats rely on a HOST agent, that inherits from HostAgent class. Hosts control the flow. A smart LLM-based host will inherit from both LLMAgent AND HostAgent.\n* Sometimes a host will not call on another agent; in this case it should just yield a normal agentoutput object that will be passed on to the groupchat.\n* The key change I originally wanted was meant to SIMPLIFY how agents were invoked in a flow and allow them to also be invoked through other means like MCP. The change was that instead of only agents like 'fetch' providing a tool, ALL participants in a groupchat should provide a tool definition for the smart LLM host to use when necessary. This would allow us to use structured outputs to call on other agents in an industry standard, agent agnostic way.\n* But the code has been difficult to implement and is now extraordinarily complicated. The core challenge has been to make smart LLM HOST Agents aware of the tools provided by other agents. There is a lot of code to try to construct this from the host agent's perspective, which is kinda dumb, because in an agentic environment, the definitions should be provided by the agents themselves. As a result, the host does not actually have a set of tools populated and the agents spend a lot of useless time announcing themselves with no effect. Because we don't provide structured tool formats to the LLM, the LLM then comes back with hallucinated tool calls.\n* We also have a complication that our agents have 'variants' that are all called in parallel. So we only want one set of tool definitions for each 'variant', not each agent. \n* The tool definition should follow autogen format, but because we need to communicate through a groupchat,  the actual tool definition should be wrapped in a message that the host can send to all agents of that 'step' type (one message for all variants). The instantiated agents should listen out for that message and act accordingly, just like they originally did. This is usually in the form of an StepRequest(AgentInput) object.\n\nWe have been iterating down what appears to be a dead end for some time now. I need a really good plan that fits the groupchat paradigm but allows agents to be called independently through MCP or through the groupchat. I want to PRIORITISE SIMPLICITY and create lightweight, configurable agents that REUSE AUTOGEN TOOL CONVENTIONS and respond in STRUCTURED output as much as possible. \n\nUse github, find issues related to tool calling, and look carefully at the code in files llm.py and structured_llmhost.py.\n\n- THINK HARDER about how to simplify our classes, reduce duplication, reduce complexity, and create a rigorous and rugged set of groupchat LLM agents.\n- Don't mess too much with the core architecutre of using an autogen orchestrator with a host and participant agents in a group chat -- that's the whole point of this approach. But we do want reusable agents that can be invoked in other ways too -- so standard interface (prioritising autogen interfaces) are the way to go.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-06-21T21:38:32Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T10:37:52Z","closed_at":"2025-07-15T10:37:52Z"}

When attempting to run:\n\n- `flows=[osb] +flow=osb run=console`\n- `flows=[trans] +flow=trans run=console`  \n- `+examples=osb_console`\n\nMultiple configuration errors occur that prevent the flows from starting.\n\n## Current Errors\n\n### 1. Path Resolution Issues\n```\nCould not find 'examples/llms/lite'\nCould not load 'examples/local'\n```\n\nThe examples configurations are looking for relative paths like `llms: lite` but Hydra is resolving them as `examples/llms/lite` instead of `/llms/lite`.\n\n### 2. Interpolation Errors  \n```\nomegaconf.errors.InterpolationKeyError: Interpolation key 'run.name' not found\n```\n\nThe console configurations reference `${run.name}` but this key is not properly initialized in the configuration chain.\n\n### 3. Invalid Flow Syntax\n```\nCould not override 'flows'. No match in the defaults list.\nTo append to your default list use +flows=['osb']\n```\n\nThe command line syntax `flows=[osb]` is rejected by Hydra.\n\n## Required Fixes\n\n### 1. Fix Example Configurations\n\nUpdate `/conf/examples/osb_console.yaml` and similar files to use absolute paths:\n\n```yaml\ndefaults:\n  - _self_\n  - /local           # Use absolute path  \n  - /flows:          # Use absolute path\n    - osb\n  - /llms: lite      # Use absolute path\n```\n\n### 2. Add Missing Run Configuration\n\nEnsure the `run` section properly defines all required interpolation keys:\n\n```yaml\nrun:\n  mode: console\n  ui: console\n  human_in_loop: true\n  flows: ${flows}\n  name: ${bm.name}\n  job: ${bm.job}\n  _target_: buttermilk.runner.flowrunner.FlowRunner  # Add if missing\n```\n\n### 3. Update Documentation\n\nProvide correct command line syntax examples:\n- `uv run python -m buttermilk.runner.cli +examples=osb_console`\n- `uv run python -m buttermilk.runner.cli +flows=osb +run=console`\n\n### 4. Create Trans Console Example\n\nAdd `/conf/examples/trans_console.yaml` similar to OSB:\n\n```yaml\ndefaults:\n  - _self_\n  - /local\n  - /flows:\n    - trans\n  - /llms: lite\n\nbm:\n  name: trans_console\n  job: flows\n\nrun:\n  mode: console\n  ui: console\n  human_in_loop: true\n  flows: ${flows}\n  name: ${bm.name}\n  job: ${bm.job}\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nAfter fixes, both flows should start successfully:\n\n1. **OSB Flow**: `uv run python -m buttermilk.runner.cli +examples=osb_console`\n   - Should initialize agents (researcher, policy_analyst, fact_checker, etc.)\n   - Should prompt user for input\n   - Should have proper tool definitions available\n\n2. **Trans Flow**: `uv run python -m buttermilk.runner.cli +examples=trans_console`  \n   - Should initialize trans flow agents\n   - Should work with console UI\n   - Should not have configuration errors\n\n## Current Status\n\nThe agent-centric tool calling system is working correctly (verified by tests), but the console UI configuration layer has path resolution and interpolation issues that prevent the flows from starting.\n\n## Priority\n\nHigh - These are user-facing configurations that should work out of the box for console-based interactions with the OSB and Trans flows.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-06-23T05:17:07Z","updated_at":"2025-08-23T23:59:54Z","closed_at":"2025-08-23T23:59:54Z"}

The host agent typically just calls basic search, and no synthesis or intelligent search planning actually occurs.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n1. **Tool Overload**: EnhancedRagAgent exposes 7+ tools to the host:\n   - `search_knowledge_base` (from parent)\n   - `semantic_search`\n   - `field_search`\n   - `hybrid_search`\n   - `analyze_query`\n   - `create_search_plan`\n   - `execute_search_plan`\n\n2. **Host Confusion**: The host LLM doesn't know which tool to use when, so it defaults to the simplest (`search_knowledge_base`)\n\n3. **No Synthesis**: Despite `enable_result_synthesis: true` in config, the agent just formats results - no actual LLM synthesis occurs\n\n4. **Unused Planning**: The query planning and search strategies are rarely used because they require multiple tool calls in sequence\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nBased on the agent's configuration and description, it should:\n\n1. **Analyze queries** to understand user intent\n2. **Plan search strategies** based on query type (e.g., search titles for policies, content for details)\n3. **Execute multi-field searches** when appropriate\n4. **Synthesize results** into coherent summaries with key themes\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Workflow Gap**: The tools are exposed individually but there's no clear workflow for the host to follow\n2. **Missing Implementation**: `_generate_simple_response()` doesn't actually synthesize - it just formats\n3. **Poor Abstraction**: Too many low-level tools exposed instead of high-level capabilities\n4. **No Host Guidance**: The host prompt doesn't explain when/how to use enhanced features\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Simplify Tool Interface\n- Expose only 2 tools:\n  - `smart_search`: Full analyze→plan→execute→synthesize workflow\n  - `simple_search`: Basic vector search fallback\n  \n### Option 2: Implement Missing Features\n- Add real LLM synthesis in `_generate_simple_response()` when synthesis is enabled\n- Create a `synthesize_results` tool that the host can explicitly call\n- Add host prompting to guide tool selection\n\n### Option 3: Workflow Orchestration\n- Create a single `research` tool that handles the entire workflow internally\n- Keep individual tools for advanced users but hide them by default\n- Add configuration to control which tools are exposed\n\n## Example\n\nCurrent reality:\n```\nUser: \"What are the policies on data retention?\"\nHost: Calls search_knowledge_base(\"policies on data retention\")\nResult: List of 5 document chunks mentioning data/retention\n```\n\nExpected enhanced behavior:\n```\nUser: \"What are the policies on data retention?\"\nHost: Calls smart_search(\"policies on data retention\")\nAgent internally:\n  1.

User asks: \"What are the data retention policies?\"\n2. Host routes to RESEARCHER\n3. RESEARCHER (via template logic):\n   - Calls search_vector_database(\"data retention policies\")\n   - Analyzes results\n   - Maybe refines: search_vector_database(\"data storage duration requirements\")\n   - Synthesizes findings\n4. Returns coherent answer to user\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nThis is a breaking change for any flows using the old RAG agents.

We need to simplify while maintaining:\n- Structured outputs (ResearchResult) \n- Original citations in all responses\n- Clear separation between search tools and synthesis agents\n\n## Current State\n- RagAgent: Complex base class with embedded ChromaDB logic\n- EnhancedRagAgent: Overly complex with search planning, multiple strategies, etc.\n- RagZot: Specialized for Zotero with custom output formats\n- All three mix tool logic with agent logic\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Phase 1: Refactor RagAgent as Thin Orchestrator\nTransform RagAgent from complex search implementation to simple orchestrator that:\n1. Uses ChromaDBSearchTool as an external tool\n2. Always returns ResearchResult structured output\n3. Ensures citations are preserved and returned\n4. Configured entirely via YAML + jinja2 templates\n\n### Phase 2: Rename and Simplify RagZot\n1. Rename to RagZotero for clarity\n2. Inherit from simplified RagAgent\n3. Override only the output format classes\n4. Remove duplicate search logic\n\n### Phase 3: Replace EnhancedRagAgent with Workbench Pattern\n1. Remove current EnhancedRagAgent implementation\n2. Create example using Autogen's Workbench for multi-tool research\n3. Configure search strategies via YAML tools configuration\n4. Use jinja2 templates for LLM guidance on tool usage\n5. Keep as separate experimental flow, not mixed with OSB/Zotero\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All RAG agents return structured ResearchResult outputs\n- [ ] Citations always included in responses\n- [ ] Search logic lives in tools, not agents\n- [ ] Configuration via YAML, orchestration via jinja2\n- [ ] Workbench example demonstrates enhanced search without code complexity\n\n## Implementation Plan\n[To be detailed after analysis]","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-07-03T16:39:35Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:02:11.841927671+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T21:02:11.841927671+10:00","close_reason":"Stale development task - closing during cleanup"}

{"id":"bm-77","title":"Enhance Weave Tracing in llmagent: Add Tool Call and LLM Response Tracing","description":"## Summary\n\nThe current weave tracing implementation provides orchestrator and agent-level traces but lacks visibility into individual tool calls and LLM responses. This issue tracks enhancing the tracing to capture every step of agent reasoning and tool execution while maintaining proper trace hierarchy.\n\n## Current State\n\n### ✅ What's Working\n- **Orchestrator-level traces**: Top-level flow execution is traced (`orchestrator.py:330-367`)\n- **Agent-level traces**: Each agent call creates a child trace (`agent.py:424-478`)\n- **Parent-child relationships**: Traces properly nest under parent calls\n- **Trace metadata**: Includes agent names, model info, parameters, and UI links\n\n### ❌ What's Missing\n1. **Tool Call Tracing**: No traces for individual tool executions (`llms.py:_call_tool()`)\n2. **LLM Response Tracing**: No traces for LLM API calls (`llms.py:AutoGenWrapper.create()`)\n3. **RAG Operations**: Search queries and results not traced\n4. **Intermediate Processing**: Template rendering, message construction not visible\n5. **Performance Metrics**: Token usage, latency not captured\n\n## Enhancement Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Tool Call Tracing\nAdd weave tracing to capture every tool execution:\n\n```python\n# In llms.py:_call_tool() ~line 450\nwith bm.weave.create_call(\n    op_name=f\"tool.{tool_name}\",\n    inputs={\"tool\": tool_name, \"arguments\": args},\n    parent=parent_call,\n    attributes={\"tool_type\": tool.__class__.__name__}\n) as tool_call:\n    result = tool.run_json(args)\n    bm.weave.finish_call(tool_call, result)\n```\n\n### Phase 2: LLM Response Tracing\nWrap all LLM API calls with traces:\n\n```python\n# In llms.py:AutoGenWrapper.create() ~line 250\nwith bm.weave.create_call(\n    op_name=\"llm.generate\",\n    inputs={\"messages\": messages, \"model\": model_name},\n    parent=parent_call,\n    attributes={\n        \"temperature\": temperature,\n        \"max_tokens\": max_tokens,\n        \"provider\": provider\n    }\n) as llm_call:\n    response = await client.create(...)\n    bm.weave.finish_call(llm_call, {\n        \"content\": response.content,\n        \"tool_calls\": response.tool_calls,\n        \"tokens\": response.usage\n    })\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Hierarchical Structure\nEnsure proper nesting of traces:\n\n```\nOrchestrator.run\n├── Agent.__call__ (reasoning step 1)\n│   ├── llm.generate (initial prompt)\n│   ├── tool.search (if RAG agent)\n│   └── tool.execute (any tool calls)\n├── Agent.__call__ (reasoning step 2)\n│   ├── llm.generate (with tool results)\n│   └── tool.execute (follow-up tools)\n└── Agent.__call__ (final response)\n    └── llm.generate (final answer)\n```\n\n### Phase 4: RAG-Specific Tracing\nFor RAG agents, trace search operations:\n\n```python\n# In rag agents\nwith bm.weave.create_call(\n    op_name=\"rag.search\",\n    inputs={\"query\": query, \"k\": k},\n    parent=parent_call\n) as search_call:\n    results = retriever.search(query, k)\n    bm.weave.finish_call(search_call, {\n        \"num_results\": len(results),\n        \"scores\": [r.score for r in results]\n    })\n```\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n- [x] Add weave tracing to `_call_tool()` method in `llms.py`\n- [x] Add weave tracing to `_execute_tools()` method in `llms.py`\n- [x] Wrap LLM calls in `AutoGenWrapper.create()` with traces\n- [ ] Add helper methods to BM class for standardized trace creation\n- [ ] Ensure parent-child relationships are maintained throughout\n- [ ] Add trace attributes for performance metrics (tokens, latency)\n- [ ] Add tracing to RAG search operations\n- [ ] Update tests to handle new trace structure\n- [ ] Add configuration to control trace verbosity levels\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Complete Visibility**: Every LLM call and tool execution appears in weave UI\n2. **Proper Hierarchy**: Traces nest correctly showing the full execution flow\n3. **Performance Data**: Token usage and latency captured for optimization\n4. **Debugging**: Can trace any agent execution step-by-step through weave\n5. **No Performance Impact**: Tracing overhead remains minimal (\u003c5% latency increase)\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1. Unit tests for each new trace point\n2. Integration tests verifying trace hierarchy\n3. Performance benchmarks comparing with/without detailed tracing\n4. Manual verification in weave UI for complex agent flows\n\n## Notes\n\n- Consider adding trace sampling for high-volume production use\n- May need to handle weave upload delays more robustly\n- Should standardize trace attribute names across the codebase\n- Consider adding trace context propagation through async boundaries","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-07-06T13:01:56Z","updated_at":"2025-09-07T22:11:08Z","closed_at":"2025-08-23T23:58:49Z"}

{"id":"bm-84","title":"LLM-Driven Debugging Infrastructure with MCP Integration","description":"## Overview\n\nThis issue builds upon the foundation established in #91 to create an LLM-driven debugging infrastructure that enables automated, intelligent debugging of Buttermilk flows. The goal is to provide tools that can be controlled dynamically by LLMs through CLI and MCP (Model Context Protocol) interfaces.\n\n## Background\n\nFrom #91, we've already implemented:\n- ✅ Backend E2E testing framework (`FlowTestClient`)\n- ✅ Frontend CLI client with WebSocket support\n- ✅ Debug infrastructure (`make debug`, comprehensive logging)\n- ✅ MCP testing tools in `buttermilk/debug/`\n- ✅ Successful real-world debugging (fixed #114)\n\n## Objectives\n\nCreate a development environment where LLMs can:\n1. Monitor API server logs in real-time\n2. Control WebSocket test clients dynamically\n3. Automate browser/frontend testing\n4. Detect and diagnose issues automatically\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### 1. Real-Time Log Analysis Tool\nCreate a CLI/MCP tool that can:\n- Tail API server logs from `/tmp/buttermilk_*.log`\n- Parse and structure log entries\n- Filter by severity, component, or pattern\n- Extract error traces and correlate with flow execution\n- Provide summaries and insights to LLMs\n\n### 2. Dynamic WebSocket Test Client\nEnhance the existing test client to be LLM-controllable:\n- CLI interface for sending commands to running flows\n- MCP tool wrapper for programmatic control\n- State inspection and assertion capabilities\n- Message history and pattern matching\n- Ability to simulate various user scenarios\n\n### 3. Browser Automation Integration\nImplement Playwright or similar tool that:\n- Can be controlled via CLI/MCP by LLMs\n- Interacts with the frontend UI\n- Captures screenshots for visual debugging\n- Validates UI state and behavior\n- Simulates complex user interactions\n\n### 4. Orchestration Layer\nCreate a unified interface that:\n- Coordinates between log analysis, WebSocket client, and browser automation\n- Provides high-level debugging commands\n- Generates debugging reports\n- Suggests fixes based on observed patterns\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Enhanced Log Analysis (Week 1)\n- [x] Create `buttermilk-logs` CLI tool\n- [x] Implement structured log parsing\n- [x] Add filtering and search capabilities\n- [ ] Create MCP wrapper for LLM access\n\n### Phase 2: Dynamic Test Client (Week 2)\n- [x] Refactor existing WebSocket client for CLI control\n- [x] Add state inspection commands\n- [x] Implement message pattern matching\n- [ ] Create MCP tool interface\n\n### Phase 3: Browser Automation (Week 3)\n- [ ] Set up Playwright infrastructure\n- [ ] Create CLI commands for UI interaction\n- [ ] Implement screenshot capture and analysis\n- [ ] Add MCP integration\n\n### Phase 4: Integration \u0026 Intelligence (Week 4)\n- [ ] Build orchestration layer\n- [ ] Create debugging workflows\n- [ ] Implement pattern recognition\n- [ ] Add self-healing capabilities\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. An LLM can independently:\n   - Detect when a flow is failing\n   - Analyze logs to identify the root cause\n   - Test hypotheses using the WebSocket client\n   - Verify fixes through browser automation\n\n2. Debugging time reduced by 50% for common issues\n\n3. New developers can use LLM assistance to understand and debug flows\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Tools must be stateless and idempotent where possible\n- Clear separation between CLI and MCP interfaces\n- Comprehensive error handling and recovery\n- Performance monitoring to avoid impacting system under test\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing debug infrastructure from #91\n- MCP protocol implementation\n- Playwright or similar browser automation library\n- Structured logging format (already in place)\n\n## References\n\n- #91 - Original integration testing issue\n- #114 - Example of successful debugging with current tools\n- MCP Documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n\n---\n\nThis issue represents the next evolution in our debugging infrastructure, moving from manual tools to intelligent, LLM-driven automation. The focus is on creating tools that can be dynamically controlled rather than static test scripts.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-07-11T09:49:49Z","updated_at":"2025-08-23T23:58:50Z","closed_at":"2025-08-23T23:58:50Z"}

Identifying and removing unused methods will improve code clarity and reduce potential confusion for developers.\n\n#### Tasks:\n1. **Audit Codebase**:\n   - Search for all methods in the Agent class and related flow architecture components.\n   - Identify methods that are not invoked anywhere in the codebase or tests.\n\n2. **Verify Usage**:\n   - Confirm that identified methods are truly unused by checking for references in:\n     - Other classes/modules.\n     - Unit tests and integration tests.\n     - Documentation.\n\n3. **Remove Unused Methods**:\n   - Safely remove methods confirmed to be unused.\n   - Ensure removal does not break existing functionality.\n\n4. **Update Documentation**:\n   - Revise any documentation that references removed methods.\n\n5. **Refactor Code**:\n   - Simplify related code if unused methods were part of larger structures.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria:\n- All unused methods are removed from the codebase.\n- No functionality is broken after removal.\n- Documentation is updated to reflect changes.\n\n#### Priority:\nMedium - Improves code maintainability and readability.\n\n#### Suggested Labels:\n- refactor\n- cleanup\n- architecture\n\n#### Note:\nThis issue is intended to be addressed in the e2etesting branch.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-07-12T01:41:58Z","updated_at":"2025-07-13T01:54:02Z","closed_at":"2025-07-13T01:54:02Z"}

Hosts should either send UIMessage with a confirmation request or other direct structured ask, or if it's the response from a LLM or a chat message to the user, it should probably be an AgentOutput message. We need consistency so that these messages are displayed in the UI just like any other agent's message -- it's a group chat, all participants should basically send the same message type and have their messages displayed the same way (including hosts AND users). This might mean we need to refactor some messages to be subclasses of a generic chat message if necessary, and then for messages with other functions (not main channel chat), we should send an Event type instead of a Message. @claude, think hard about this and propose a solution please.\n\nhttps://github.com/qut-dmrc/buttermilk/blob/06f3f9b077ec62ba20724c63890259ea77cbd40e/buttermilk/agents/flowcontrol/structured_llmhost.py#L131","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-07-19T14:37:07Z","updated_at":"2025-07-23T08:31:40Z","closed_at":"2025-07-23T08:31:40Z"}

This violates the skill's own principles:\n\n\u003e **Don't hyperfocus**: Create specific rules for specific problems\n\u003e **Don't overreact**: Add heavyweight enforcement for minor issues\n\n## What Happened\n\n1. Agent wrote spec to wrong location (.claude/skills/tasks/)\n2. /learn invoked\n3. Agent added \"File Locations\" section to AGENTS.md with specific rule about specs\n4. User correctly identified this as overreaction - AGENTS.md changes affect ALL agents\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe /learn skill itself has a design flaw: it requires agents to make file changes (\"Agents are stateless - you MUST edit a file\") but doesn't adequately guard against overreaction when making those changes.\n\nThe skill text says \"start small\" but the pressure to \"make a persistent change\" leads to overreach.\n\n## Questions to Investigate\n\n1. Should /learn have a \"cooling off\" mechanism before high-magnitude changes (AGENTS.md, AXIOMS, hooks)?\n2. Should there be a review gate for changes to core framework files?\n3. Is the \"MUST edit a file\" requirement too strong? Should \"create an issue\" be sufficient for first observations?\n4. How do we balance \"agents are stateless\" with \"don't overreact\"?\n\n## Proposed Direction\n\nConsider adding to /learn skill:\n- Tiered change magnitude awareness\n- \"Create issue first, edit only on escalation\" pattern\n- List of protected files that require user approval\n\n## Reverted Change\n\nRemoved the \"File Locations\" section from AGENTS.md (was lines 44-46).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T11:51:50.329870688+10:00","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:05:03.697710143+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T21:05:03.697710143+10:00","close_reason":"Stale framework development task - cleanup","labels":["experiment"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ns-59b","depends_on_id":"ns-6hm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-13T14:23:43.563159041+10:00","created_by":"Nicolas Suzor","metadata":"{}"}]}

Hydrator classifies as **batch** workflow (trigger: \"process\", multiple items)\n2. Hydrator suggests parallel Task() calls for each annotation\n3. Main agent spawns subagents to handle each annotation in parallel\n\nActual:\n1. Agent executed directly without hydrator batch classification\n2. Agent processed items sequentially (not parallel)\n3. Agent did not delegate to subagents\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Gap 1: Batch workflow template missing parallel delegation\nWORKFLOWS.md line 120-136 shows batch workflow but only as sequential TodoWrite steps, not parallel Task() spawning.\n\n### Gap 2: Prompt-hydrator has no parallel execution guidance\nagents/prompt-hydrator.md doesn't mention when to suggest parallel subagent execution for batch items.\n\n### Gap 3: No explicit batch workflow detection for skills with multiple targets\nWhen a skill (like annotations) discovers multiple items to process, there's no instruction to switch to parallel mode.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n1. Update WORKFLOWS.md batch workflow template to show parallel Task() pattern\n2. Add parallel execution guidance to prompt-hydrator agent\n3. Consider: skill output could signal \"batch detected\" to trigger parallel mode\n\n## Queued Analysis\n\n- [ ] Review batch workflow template in WORKFLOWS.md\n- [ ] Update prompt-hydrator.md with parallel delegation guidance\n- [ ] Test with annotations skill on multi-item batch","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T16:12:25.507489092+10:00","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:05:24.008879198+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T21:05:24.008879198+10:00","close_reason":"Stale framework development task - cleanup","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ns-b9l","depends_on_id":"ns-y8v","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T16:12:31.32480752+10:00","created_by":"Nicolas Suzor","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"ns-b9l","depends_on_id":"ns-6hm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-13T14:23:49.20212761+10:00","created_by":"Nicolas Suzor","metadata":"{}"}]}

I want to see a report not just on faults, but efficiency: what worked, what didn't, what stuff was injected that appears to be useless, what information should ideally have been injected but was not JIT, where do we see repetitive or wasteful token use, what could we replace with a script or a skill, etc.\n\n## Approach: Qualitative LLM Assessment\n\n**Key principle**: Use a capable LLM to read and assess the transcript holistically against criteria. NO tokenizers, word counts, keyword matching, or mechanical pattern detection. The LLM uses semantic understanding to make qualitative judgments.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria (5 Dimensions)\n\n1. **Framework Effectiveness** - Did hooks/skills fire appropriately? Violations caught or missed?\n2. **Context Injection Utility** - What was used vs wasteful vs missing (JIT gaps)?\n3. **Process Efficiency** - Where was work repeated or bloated?\n4. **Consolidation Opportunities** - What could become scripts/skills?\n5. **What Worked Well** - Which components demonstrably helped?\n\n## Technical Constraints\n\n- Full transcript (~60K tokens) may exceed context window\n- Chunking strategy: Split at turn boundaries, synthesize findings\n- Abridged transcript available (~39KB) for overview\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [ ] Workflow file at `/home/nic/src/academicOps/skills/audit/workflows/session-effectiveness.md`\n- [ ] Integration with main audit skill\n- [ ] Test run on sample transcript (130da570 audit epic)\n- [ ] Report covers all 5 evaluation dimensions with evidence citations\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1.

User asked about GITHUB_TOKEN in .env file (dotfiles repo)\n2. Agent searched dotfiles repo for uses of GITHUB_TOKEN\n3. Agent concluded \"only thing that needed that token was trigger-ios-capture.sh\"\n4. Agent failed to recognize that .env exports to ALL shells system-wide\n\n**Critical error**: Searching the current repository is insufficient to understand uses of a shell environment variable. The .env file exports to the entire system - any tool, script, or application could use that token.\n\n## Scope Reasoning Gap\n\n**System-wide resources include**:\n- Environment variables exported in dotfiles (.env, .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)\n- PATH modifications\n- Shell aliases and functions\n- Global git config\n- System-wide installed tools/binaries\n\n**Repository-local resources include**:\n- Scripts in the repo\n- Configuration files used only by dotfiles setup\n- Documentation about dotfiles\n\n**The mistake**: Agent treated a system-wide resource (exported env var) as if it were repo-local.\n\n## Related Patterns\n\nSimilar to:\n- aops-226: Agent made incorrect structural assumptions about framework\n- aops-184: Agent lacked project context\n- aops-259: Agent asked lazy questions instead of researching\n\nBut distinct: This is specifically about **scope reasoning** - understanding when a resource affects the entire system vs just the current repo.\n\n## Intervention Taken\n\n**Date**: 2026-01-11\n**Action**: Added H20 to HEURISTICS.md - \"Understand System-Wide vs Repository-Local Scope\"\n**Level**: Minimal (framework-wide heuristic)\n**Rationale**: First occurrence of this specific pattern; start with lightweight instruction\n\n**Heuristic content**: Distinguishes system-wide resources (env vars, PATH, aliases, global git config) from repo-local resources (scripts, config files, docs).

Hydrator output included: `Workflow: [[workflows/batch-processing]] (with [[workflows/feature-dev]] for workflow documentation)`\n3. Generated plan had supervisor doing all pre-work (list files, check archive, test small batches)\n4. Actual workflow file describes **worker-hypervisor architecture** - contradicts supervisor-heavy approach\n5. Evidence suggests hydrator matched 'batch' keyword → workflow reference, but never Read the file\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**Component**: prompt-hydrator agent (agents/prompt-hydrator/AGENT.md)\n\nHydrator has access to Read/Grep/Bash tools but appears to:\n- Pattern match keywords → workflow names\n- Reference workflow by name\n- NOT actually read workflow file content\n- Generate plans based on generic assumptions instead of workflow instructions\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen hydrator identifies a matching workflow:\n1. **Read** the workflow file\n2. Extract key principles/steps\n3. **Use those principles** to shape the execution plan\n4. Verify plan aligns with workflow architecture\n\n## Impact\n\n- Generates plans that contradict established workflows\n- Defeats purpose of having workflow documentation\n- Wastes tokens on incorrect plans\n- User must catch and correct the mismatch\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review prompt-hydrator agent instructions\n2. Check if agent explicitly uses Read tool for referenced workflows\n3. Add workflow file reading to hydrator's process\n4. Test with batch-processing workflow as case study\n5. Consider: should hydrator auto-read workflows, or should workflow files be pre-loaded in context?","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-16T11:09:13.85707863+10:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T15:12:56.050930752+10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T15:12:56.050933016+10:00"}

{"id":"ns-mhs","title":"learning: Agent claimed success without verifying output quality","description":"## Initial Observation\n\n**Date**: 2026-01-10\n**Category**: learning\n**Proximate Cause**: Agent marked transcript enhancement complete after seeing \"22 entries, 13 hooks\" without visually confirming the hooks had useful content\n**Root Cause**: H37a (\"Full Evidence for Human Validation\") doesn't emphasize agents must verify their OWN output before claiming success\n**Root Cause Category**: Clarity Failure\n**Responsible Component**: HEURISTICS.md H37a\n\n## Observation\n\nAgent modified transcript generator to show \"ALL hooks in full mode\" but didn't verify the output was actually useful. Result: empty hooks like:\n\n```\n- Hook(SubagentStop: agent-a4dd383) ✓\n- Hook(SubagentStop: agent-ac11248) ✓\n- Hook(SubagentStop: agent-aadcee7) ✓\n```\n\nThese provide zero information - just that hooks fired.

It doesn't say agents must ALSO validate their output before presenting.\n\n**Gap**: No instruction tells agents to read/verify their own generated output before claiming task complete.\n\n## Fix Applied\n\nReverted filter: hooks without content, skills_matched, files_loaded, or errors are now filtered out (regardless of full/abridged mode). Empty hooks are noise.\n\n## Proposed Clarification\n\nConsider adding to H3 (Verification Before Assertion) or H37a:\n- \"Before claiming success on output generation, READ the output and verify it provides useful information\"\n- \"Quantity metrics (entries, hooks) are not quality metrics\"\n\n## Related\n\n- Related to: ns-9o2 (agent weakened test criteria - different QA failure pattern)\n- Related to: H3 (Verification Before Assertion)\n- Related to: H37a (Full Evidence for Human Validation)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T20:27:38.355429609+10:00","updated_at":"2026-01-10T20:27:38.355429609+10:00","labels":["learning"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ns-mhs","depends_on_id":"ns-6hm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-13T14:23:54.125283733+10:00","created_by":"Nicolas Suzor","metadata":"{}"}]}

Each Framework Reflection represents a distinct work session that should be preserved.\n\n## Key changes needed\n1. extract_reflection_from_entries() should return ALL reflections (list) instead of single reflection\n2. _process_reflection() must loop over multiple reflections and create separate insights files\n3. Session file naming needs update: one transcript may produce multiple insight JSONs (e.g., ...-0.json, ...-1.json or timestamped)\n4. Transcript markdown generation: consider whether to show all reflections in one file or split\n\n## Files to modify\n- aops-core/lib/transcript_parser.py: extract_reflection_from_entries() (lines 120-173) - change return type to list\n- aops-core/scripts/transcript.py: _process_reflection() - loop over multiple reflections\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n1.

The agent sees the plan, executes the task directly, and skips the skill.\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. Level 2b (Command instructions): Strengthen hydrator output emphasis on skill invocation\n2.
