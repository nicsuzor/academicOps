# Decision Queue: Batch Decision Processing for Task Unblocking

**Task**: `aops-f4b71ada`
**Status**: Requirements confirmed - ready for implementation
**Author**: Claude (Audre)
**Date**: 2026-02-03

## Giving Effect

- [[skills/decision-extract/SKILL.md]] - Skill for extracting pending decisions to daily note
- [[skills/decision-apply/SKILL.md]] - Skill for applying annotated decisions back to sources
- [[agents/effectual-planner.md]] - Agent that orchestrates decision queue workflow

## Problem Statement

Not all blocked tasks require substantive work. Many are waiting for a simple decision:

- RSVP to a meeting invitation (yes/no/maybe)
- Approve or reject an email draft
- Sign off on a code review
- Go/no-go on a proposal
- Choose between options A, B, or C

These decisions scatter across:
- Task system (tasks with `status: waiting` or `assignee: nic`)
- Outlook calendar (meeting invitations awaiting response)
- Outlook inbox (emails requiring a reply decision)
- Code review requests (PRs awaiting approval)

The cognitive load of context-switching between these scattered decisions creates friction. Worse, undecided items silently block downstream work - a single unreviewed PR can stall an entire feature branch.

## Proposed Solution

A two-phase workflow orchestrated by the effectual planner:

### Phase 1: Extract (`/decision-extract`)

The effectual planner scans all decision sources and produces a prioritized markdown file containing:

1. Each pending decision with context
2. Space for the user's annotation
3. Priority ordering based on:
   - How many other tasks this decision unblocks
   - Due dates/deadlines
   - Age (older decisions surface first)

### Phase 2: Apply (`/decision-apply`)

After the user annotates their decisions, a second skill:

1. Reads the annotated markdown file
2. Updates the original sources (tasks, calendar, email drafts)
3. Unblocks dependent tasks
4. Reports what was resolved

## Decision Classification

### What IS a Decision

| Source | Decision Type | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Task system | Status = `waiting` with `assignee: nic` | "Approve design doc" |
| Task system | Status = `review` | "Review implementation" |
| Task system | Type = `decision` (proposed new type) | "Choose auth provider" |
| Outlook calendar | Unresponded meeting invitation | "Team standup - RSVP" |
| Outlook inbox | Flagged email awaiting reply | "Vendor proposal - reply needed" |
| Code review | PR assigned for review | "PR #123 - approve/request changes" |

### What is NOT a Decision

| Item | Why Excluded |
|------|--------------|
| Task: "Write chapter 3" | Requires substantive work |
| Task: "Fix authentication bug" | Requires investigation and coding |
| Email: Newsletter | No response expected |
| Calendar: Accepted meeting | Already decided |

### Decision Detection Heuristics

**From task system:**
```
(status = 'waiting' OR status = 'review')
AND assignee = 'nic'
AND type NOT IN ('project', 'epic', 'goal')
```

**From Outlook calendar:**
```
response_status = 'not_responded'
AND start_date > now()
```

**From Outlook inbox:**
```
is_flagged = true
OR category = 'Decision Required'
```

## Output Format: Decision Queue File

# Decision Queue - 2026-02-03

Generated by effectual planner at 14:30 UTC.

## Instructions

For each decision below:
1. Read the context
2. Write your decision in the `Decision:` field
3. Optionally add notes
4. Save the file

Then run `/decision-apply` to process your decisions.

## Summary

- **Total decisions**: 4
- **High priority**: 2
- **Medium priority**: 1
- **Low priority**: 1
- **Estimated time**: 15-20 minutes

<!-- Machine-readable section - DO NOT EDIT -->
```yaml
decisions:
  - id: D001
    source_type: task
    source_id: aops-abc123
    decision: null
    processed: false
  - id: D002
    source_type: calendar
    source_id: entry_id_xyz
    decision: null
    processed: false
  # ...
```
```

## Apply Phase Logic

When `/decision-apply` runs:

### For Task Decisions
```python
if decision in ['approve', 'yes', 'go']:
    update_task(id, status='active')  # Unblock
    # Also unblock all tasks that depend_on this one
elif decision in ['reject', 'no', 'cancel']:
    update_task(id, status='cancelled')
    # Handle orphaned dependents
```

### For Calendar RSVPs
```python
if decision == 'accept':
    calendar_accept_invitation(entry_id)
elif decision == 'decline':
    calendar_respond_to_meeting(entry_id, response='decline')
elif decision == 'tentative':
    calendar_respond_to_meeting(entry_id, response='tentative')
```

### For Email Replies
```python
if decision == 'reply_yes':
    if notes is None:
        raise ValueError("Notes required for email reply decision")
    messages_reply(entry_id, body=notes)
elif decision == 'delegate':
    if delegate_email is None:
        raise ValueError("Delegate email required for delegation")
    messages_forward(entry_id, to=delegate_email, body=notes)
```

## Integration Points

### With Daily Note (`/daily`)

The daily skill should include a "Pending Decisions" section:
```markdown
## Pending Decisions (5)

You have 5 decisions awaiting your input:
- 2 high priority (blocking other work)
- 3 low priority

Run `/decision-extract` to batch process them.
```

### With Effectual Planner Agent

The effectual planner can be invoked directly:
```
"What decisions am I blocking? Show me everything waiting on me."
```

This should invoke the decision extraction logic and present results conversationally.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase A: Requirements (CONFIRMED 2026-02-03)

1. **Decision sources**: Task system only (start minimal)
   - [x] Task system (status: waiting/review, assignee: nic)
   - [ ] Outlook calendar (future expansion)
   - [ ] Outlook inbox (future expansion)
   - [ ] GitHub PRs (future expansion)

2. **Output location**: Daily note inline
   - Decisions section embedded directly in daily note
   - No separate file management needed

3. **Apply behavior**: Fully automatic
   - Trust user annotations completely
   - Execute all actions without confirmation prompts

4. **Frequency**: Both
   - Summary count appears in `/daily` briefing
   - Full extraction available via `/decision-extract` on demand

### Phase B: Extraction Logic

- Query task system for decision-type tasks
- Query Outlook calendar for unresponded invitations
- Query Outlook inbox for flagged/categorized emails
- Score and sort by priority
- Generate markdown file

### Phase C: Annotation Workflow

- User reviews and annotates file
- File format supports both human-readable and machine-parseable sections

### Phase D: Apply Logic

- Parse annotated decisions
- Execute actions for each decision type
- Update source systems
- Report results

### Phase E: Integration

- Hook into `/daily` skill
- Add decision summary to effectual planner repertoire

## Open Questions

1. **Partial decisions**: What if the user only annotates some decisions? Skip the rest? Prompt?

2. **Decision expiry**: Should old unannotated decision files be auto-archived?

3. **Undo**: If a decision was wrong, how to reverse? (Especially for sent emails)

4. **Conflict resolution**: What if the same item appears in multiple extracts?

5. **Delegation decisions**: Should "delegate to X" create a new task assigned to X?

## Success Criteria

1. User can run `/decision-extract` and get a prioritized list within 30 seconds
2. Annotating the file takes <1 minute per decision (just marking checkboxes)
3. Running `/decision-apply` unblocks dependent tasks automatically
4. Daily note surfaces decision count without running full extraction
5. Decision backlog trends downward over time (measurable)
