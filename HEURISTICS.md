# Heuristics

## Skills Contain No Dynamic Content (P#19)

**Statement**: Current state lives in $ACA_DATA, not in skills.

**Derivation**: Skills are shared framework infrastructure. Dynamic content in skills creates merge conflicts and state corruption.

---

## Semantic Link Density (P#54)

**Statement**: Related files MUST link to each other. Orphan files break navigation.

**Derivation**: Links create navigable knowledge graphs. Orphans are undiscoverable.

---

## File Category Classification (P#56)

**Statement**: Every file has exactly one category (spec, ref, docs, script, instruction, template, state).

**Derivation**: Mixed-category files are hard to maintain. Clear classification enables appropriate handling.

---

## Never Bypass Locks Without User Direction (P#57)

**Statement**: Agents must NOT remove or bypass lock files (sync locks, file locks, process locks) without explicit user authorization.

**Derivation**: Locks exist to prevent data corruption from concurrent operations. Removing a lock without understanding whether another process is active risks corrupting git state, SQLite databases, or file systems. Multi-agent concurrency is not currently architected. When encountering locks, agents must HALT and ask the user rather than attempting workarounds.

---

## Indices Before Exploration (P#58)

**Statement**: Prefer curated indices (memory server, zotero, bd) over broad filesystem searches for exploratory queries.

**Derivation**: Grep is for needles, not fishing expeditions. Semantic search tools exist precisely to answer "find things related to X" - broad pattern matching across directories is wasteful and may surface irrelevant or sensitive content.
