# Heuristics

Working hypotheses validated by evidence. Full definitions: see `heuristics/` folder.

| Pri | Name                                    | Statement                                                                                               |
| --- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10  | [[skill-invocation-framing]]            | When directing an agent to use a skill, explain it provides needed context and use explicit syntax: ... |
| 12  | [[skill-first-action]]                  | Almost all agent actions should follow skill invocation for repeatability.                              |
| 13  | [[verification-before-assertion]]       | Agents must run verification commands BEFORE claiming success, not after.                               |
| 14  | [[explicit-instructions-override]]      | When a user provides explicit instructions, follow them literally. Do not interpret, soften, or "imp... |
| 15  | [[error-messages-primary-evidence]]     | When an error occurs, quote the error message exactly. Never paraphrase.                                |
| 16  | [[context-uncertainty-favors-skills]]   | When uncertain whether a task requires a skill, invoke it. The cost of unnecessary context is lower ... |
| 17  | [[link-dont-repeat]]                    | Reference information rather than restating it. Brief inline context OK; multi-line summaries are no... |
| 18  | [[avoid-namespace-collisions]]          | Use unique names across all namespaces (skills, commands, hooks, agents).                               |
| 19  | [[skills-no-dynamic-content]]           | Current state lives in $ACA_DATA, not in skills.                                                        |
| 20  | [[light-instructions-via-reference]]    | Framework instructions should be brief and reference authoritative sources rather than hardcoding co... |
| 25  | [[no-promises-without-instructions]]    | Create persistent instructions or don't promise. Verbal commitments without framework support will b... |
| 26  | [[semantic-search-over-keyword]]        | Use memory server for semantic search, never grep markdown for knowledge retrieval.                     |
| 27  | [[context-over-algorithms]]             | Give agents enough context to make decisions. Never use algorithmic matching (fuzzy, keyword, regex)... |
| 28  | [[edit-source-run-setup]]               | Never modify runtime config directly. Edit source files and run setup to regenerate.                    |
| 29  | [[mandatory-second-opinion]]            | Plans must be reviewed by critic agent before presenting to user.                                       |
| 30  | [[streamlit-hot-reloads]]               | Don't restart Streamlit after changes. It hot-reloads automatically.                                    |
| 33  | [[use-askuserquestion]]                 | When you need user input to proceed (clarification, choice between options, approval), use the AskUs... |
| 34  | [[check-skill-conventions]]             | Check relevant skill for naming/format conventions before creating files in domain-specific location... |
| 35  | [[distinguish-script-vs-llm]]           | Document whether content is for script processing or LLM reading. Workflow differs.                     |
| 36  | [[questions-require-answers]]           | When user asks a question, ANSWER first. Do not jump to implementing or debugging. After reflection,... |
| 37  | [[critical-thinking-over-compliance]]   | Apply judgment to instructions. When instructions seem wrong, say so.                                   |
| 41  | [[core-first-expansion]]                | Only concern ourselves with the core. Expand slowly, one piece at a time.                               |
| 42  | [[indices-before-exploration]]          | Check index files (ROADMAP.md, README.md, INDEX.md) before using glob/grep to explore.                  |
| 43  | [[synthesize-after-resolution]]         | Strip deliberation from specs. Keep only the resolved decisions.                                        |
| 44  | [[ship-scripts-dont-inline]]            | Create scripts, never inline Python in markdown or prompts.                                             |
| 45  | [[user-centric-acceptance]]             | Describe USER outcomes, not implementation details.                                                     |
| 46  | [[semantic-vs-episodic-storage]]        | Classify content before creating. Semantic (timeless truth) goes to $ACA_DATA. Episodic (observation... |
| 47  | [[debug-dont-redesign]]                 | When debugging, propose fixes within current design. Don't pivot architectures without approval.        |
| 48  | [[mandatory-acceptance-testing]]        | Feature development includes acceptance tests. No feature is complete without verification.             |
| 49  | [[todowrite-vs-persistent-tasks]]       | TodoWrite for approved steps only. Use bd/tasks for work that spans sessions.                           |
| 50  | [[check-docs-before-guessing]]          | When uncertain about tool/command syntax, CHECK documentation (--help, guides, MCP tools) instead of... |
| 50  | [[design-first-not-constraint-first]]   | Start from "what do we need?" not "what do we have?" Current state is not a constraint.                 |
| 51  | [[cynical-review-of-conclusions]]       | Before attributing failure to a specific cause (model, component, configuration), verify the attribu... |
| 51  | [[no-llm-calls-in-hooks]]               | Hooks never call LLM directly. Spawn background subagent instead.                                       |
| 52  | [[delete-dont-deprecate]]               | When consolidating files, DELETE old ones. Don't mark "superseded". Git has history.                    |
| 53  | [[real-data-fixtures]]                  | Use real captured data for tests, not fabricated examples.                                              |
| 54  | [[semantic-link-density]]               | Related files MUST link to each other. Orphan files break navigation.                                   |
| 55  | [[spec-first-file-modification]]        | Check/update governing spec first before modifying framework files.                                     |
| 56  | [[file-category-classification]]        | Every file has exactly one category (spec, ref, docs, script, instruction, template, state).            |
| 57  | [[llm-semantic-evaluation]]             | When verifying outcomes, use LLM semantic understanding to evaluate whether the INTENT was satisfied... |
| 58  | [[full-evidence-for-validation]]        | Demo tests must expose the ENTIRE INTERNAL WORKING of the feature being demonstrated - all intermedi... |
| 59  | [[real-fixtures-over-contrived]]        | Test real scenarios, not contrived examples that pass surface checks.                                   |
| 60  | [[execution-over-inspection]]           | Compliance verification REQUIRES actual execution. Comparing fields, validating YAML, pattern matchi... |
| 61  | [[side-effects-over-response]]          | Use observable side-effects for verification, not response text parsing.                                |
| 62  | [[test-failure-requires-user-decision]] | When a test fails during verification, agents MUST report failure and STOP. Agents cannot modify tes... |
| 63  | [[no-horizontal-dividers]]              | Use headings for structure, not horizontal lines (`---`, `***`, `___`). Horizontal lines are visual ... |

## Domain-Specific Heuristics

Some heuristics apply only within specific domains. See the relevant skill:

- **Framework development**: `framework` skill
- **Feature development**: `feature-dev` skill
- **Knowledge persistence**: `remember` skill
- **Research data**: `analyst` skill
- **Task management**: `tasks` skill
