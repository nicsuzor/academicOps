# Framework Audit Skill

Comprehensive governance audit for the academicOps framework.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Full health report
cd $AOPS && uv run python scripts/audit_framework_health.py -m

# Individual checks
uv run python scripts/check_skill_line_count.py
uv run python scripts/check_broken_wikilinks.py
uv run python scripts/check_orphan_files.py
uv run python scripts/check_index_completeness.py
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Health Metrics

Run comprehensive health audit first:

```bash
cd $AOPS && uv run python scripts/audit_framework_health.py \
  --output /tmp/health-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

This generates:
- `/tmp/health-YYYYMMDD.json` - Machine-readable metrics
- `/tmp/health-YYYYMMDD.md` - Human-readable report

**Metrics tracked**: See [[specs/framework-health.md]]

### Phase 1: Structure Audit

Compare filesystem to documentation:

1. **Scan filesystem**: `find $AOPS -type f -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/__pycache__/*" | sort`
2. **Compare to INDEX.md**: Flag missing or extra entries
3. **Check cross-references**: Verify `→` references point to existing files
4. **Find broken wikilinks**: Grep for `[[...]]` patterns, validate targets exist

### Phase 2: Reference Graph & Link Audit

Build reference graph and check linking conventions:

```bash
cd $AOPS

# Generate graph
uv run python skills/audit/scripts/build_reference_map.py

# Find orphans and violations
uv run python skills/audit/scripts/find_orphans.py

# Or use the health script for wikilink/orphan checks
uv run python scripts/check_broken_wikilinks.py
uv run python scripts/check_orphan_files.py
```

**Linking rules to enforce**:
- Skills via invocation (`Skill(skill="x")`), not file paths
- No backward links (children → parent)
- Parents must reference children
- Use wikilinks, not backticks for graph connectivity
- Full relative paths in wikilinks

### Phase 3: Skill Content Audit

For each `$AOPS/skills/*/SKILL.md`:

1. **Size check**: Must be <500 lines
2. **Actionability test**: Each section must tell agents WHAT TO DO
3. **Content separation violations**:
   - ❌ Multi-paragraph "why" → move to spec
   - ❌ Historical context → delete
   - ❌ Reference material >20 lines → move to `references/`

### Phase 4: Justification Audit

For each significant file in `$AOPS/`:

1. **Search specs**: Grep `$AOPS/specs/` for references
2. **Check core docs**: JIT-INJECTION.md, README.md, INDEX.md
3. **Classify**: Justified / Implicit / Orphan

**Skip**: `__pycache__/`, `.git/`, individual files within skills, tests, assets

### Phase 5: Documentation Accuracy

Verify `docs/execution-flow.md` reflects actual hook architecture:

1. Parse Mermaid for hook names
2. Compare to hooks/router.py dispatch mappings
3. Compare to settings.json hook events
4. Flag drift

### Phase 6: Regenerate Generated Indices

Generated indices are root-level files for agent consumption. See [[specs/generated-indices]].

**Regenerate each deterministically from sources:**

#### INDEX.md
- Scan `$AOPS/` directory structure
- Extract file purposes from frontmatter/headers
- Output annotated file tree

#### RULES.md

**Hook→Axiom Declaration Convention**:

Every hook that enforces an axiom MUST declare it in its module docstring:
```python
"""
Hook description.

Enforces: A#28 (Current State Machine)
"""
```

Multiple axioms: `Enforces: A#7, A#15 (Fail-Fast, Trust Version Control)`

**Derivation sources**:
- `hooks/*.py` docstrings - parse "Enforces:" lines for axiom mappings
- `config/claude/settings.json` - deny rules map to axioms via comments
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - commit-time checks

**Cross-reference validation**:
1. Parse all hooks for "Enforces:" declarations
2. Compare against RULES.md Axiom→Enforcement table
3. Flag discrepancies:
   - Hook declares axiom but RULES.md shows "Prompt" level only
   - RULES.md lists hook but hook lacks "Enforces:" declaration
   - Axiom has Hard/Soft Gate in RULES.md but no hook declares it

**Output**: Table mapping each axiom to its enforcement mechanism, hook, trigger point, and level.

#### WORKFLOWS.md
Derive task routing from:
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter - what task types each skill handles
- `agents/*.md` - what workflows each agent uses
- `hooks/guardrails.md` - type→guardrail mappings

Output: Table of task types, when to use each, workflow, and skill.

**Each generated index must include header:**
```
> **Generated by audit skill** - Do not edit manually.
```

### Phase 7: Other Updates

1. **Fix README.md**: Update tables
2. **Report orphans**: Flag for human review (do NOT auto-delete)
3. **Report violations**: List with file:line refs

## Report Format

Output a structured report:

```
## Audit Report

### Structure Issues
- Missing from INDEX.md: skills/foo/
- Broken wikilinks: [[nonexistent.md]] in X.md

### Skill Content Violations
- skills/foo/SKILL.md:45-67 - explanatory content (move to spec)
- skills/bar/SKILL.md - 623 lines (>500 limit)

### Execution Flow Drift
- Hook in code, missing from diagram: unified_logger.py (PostToolUse)
- Hook in diagram, not in router.py: old_hook.py

### Justification Status

**Justified** (N files) - spec exists:
- AXIOMS.md → specs/meta-framework.md
- hooks/user_prompt_submit.py → specs/prompt-enricher.md

**Implicit** (N files) - in docs, no dedicated spec:
- FRAMEWORK.md → JIT-INJECTION.md
- README.md → framework convention

**Orphan candidates** (N files) - no reference found:
- docs/OLD-FILE.md

### Generated Indices Regenerated
- INDEX.md: [N] files mapped
- RULES.md: [N] enforcement mechanisms
- WORKFLOWS.md: [N] task types

### Other Actions Taken
- Updated README.md commands table

### Requires Human Review
- Orphan: docs/OLD-FILE.md - delete or create spec?
```

## README.md Structure Target

Brief overview (~100-150 lines):

```markdown
# academicOps Framework

Academic support framework for Claude Code. Minimal, fight bloat.

## Quick Start
[paths, principles links]

## How Enforcement Works

[Mermaid flowchart showing 7-level mechanism ladder]

The framework influences agent behavior through layered defenses:

| Level | Mechanism | When | What It Does |
|-------|-----------|------|--------------|
| 1a-c | Prompt text | Session start | Mention → Rule → Emphatic+Reasoned |
| 2 | Intent router | Before task | Intelligent steering, skill suggestions |
| 3a-b | Tool restriction / Skill abstraction | Tool use | Force correct workflow |
| 4 | Pre-tool hooks | Before action | Block before damage |
| 5 | Post-tool validation | After action | Catch violations |
| 6 | Deny rules | Tool use | Hard block, no exceptions |
| 7 | Pre-commit | Git commit | Last line of defense |

See [[docs/ENFORCEMENT.md]] for practical guide, [[specs/enforcement.md]] for architecture.

## Commands
[table: command | purpose]

## Skills
[table: skill | purpose]

## Hooks
[table: hook | trigger | purpose]

## Agents
[table: agent | purpose]
```

**Enforcement flowchart requirement**: README.md MUST include a simplified Mermaid diagram derived from [[docs/ENFORCEMENT.md]] (the practical 7-level mechanism ladder). The diagram should show the enforcement levels (1a-7) in a way that helps new users understand when each mechanism operates. Note: `specs/enforcement.md` is architectural philosophy; `docs/ENFORCEMENT.md` is the practical guide.

## INDEX.md Structure Target

Complete file-to-function mapping:

```markdown
# Framework Index

## File Tree
$AOPS/
├── AXIOMS.md                # Inviolable principles
├── [complete annotated tree...]

## Cross-References
### Command → Skill
### Skill → Skill
### Agent → Skill
```

## Validation Criteria

- README.md < 200 lines
- README.md has "How Enforcement Works" section with Mermaid diagram
- INDEX.md has every directory
- All `→` references resolve
- No broken `[[wikilinks]]`
- All SKILL.md files < 500 lines
- No explanatory content in SKILL.md files
- Orphan count reported (0 ideal)
- `docs/execution-flow.md` matches hooks/router.py dispatch table
- Generated indices (INDEX.md, RULES.md, WORKFLOWS.md) include "Generated by audit" header
- Generated indices reflect current source file state
- **Hook→Axiom accuracy**: Every hook with "Enforces:" declaration is in RULES.md with correct level (not just "Prompt")
- **Enforcement completeness**: Every axiom with Hard/Soft Gate in RULES.md has a corresponding hook with "Enforces:" declaration
