# Cognitive Load Dashboard

Single Streamlit dashboard for task visibility and session activity monitoring.

## Overview

Live web dashboard displaying high-priority tasks and Claude Code session activity across all projects. Designed for desktop monitoring and mobile/tablet access when away from desk.

## Problems Solved

1. **Terminal indistinguishability** - Tasks buried in terminal history
2. **No activity log** - Can't see what happened while away
3. **Static visualization** - Excalidraw dashboards don't auto-update
4. **Away-from-desk blindness** - No mobile/tablet access to task state
5. **Cross-machine blindness** - No view of activity on other machines

## When to Use

- "Check task priorities"
- "What's urgent?"
- "Show me focus tasks"
- "What happened today?"
- "What sessions are active?"

## Running

```bash
cd $AOPS && uv run streamlit run skills/dashboard/dashboard.py
```

## Access

- **Desktop**: http://localhost:8501
- **Tablet/Phone**: http://<desktop-ip>:8501

## Components

### NOW Panel
Primary focus from daily notes. Shows current task, next action, and progress bar.

### Blockers Panel
Items marked as blockers in daily notes. Red-themed for visibility.

### Done Today Panel
Completed tasks and outcomes from daily notes.

### Cross-Machine Activity Panel
Recent prompts from all machines via Cloudflare R2. Grouped by hostname.

**Requirements**: Set `PROMPT_LOG_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Session Insights Panel
Framework effectiveness metrics auto-generated by session-insights skill via Gemini analysis. Displays:
- **Skill Compliance Rate**: % of skill suggestions actually invoked (feedback on prompt hydration effectiveness)
- **Corrections**: Count of agent behavioral corrections in sessions
- **Failures**: Count of failure incidents by category (context-gap, skill-bypass, navigation, hallucination, etc.)
- **Successes**: Count of well-completed tasks, especially those leveraging recommended skills
- **Top Context Gaps**: Most frequent missing context that caused mistakes

Data source: `$ACA_DATA/dashboard/synthesis.json` (generated by session-insights skill Step 6)

### Project Cards
Per-project aggregated view showing:
- Accomplishments (from daily notes)
- Priority tasks (P0/P1)
- Memory notes (from sessions)
- Git commits (last 24h)

Color-coded by project (matches Peacock theme).

## Architecture

### Data Sources

| Source | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Task files | `skills.tasks.task_loader.load_focus_tasks()` |
| Session JSONLs | `lib.session_reader.SessionProcessor` |
| Daily notes | `lib.session_analyzer.SessionAnalyzer.parse_daily_log()` |
| Cross-machine prompts | `fetch_cross_machine_prompts()` via Cloudflare R2 |
| Git activity | `get_project_git_activity()` subprocess |
| Session Insights | Pre-mined from `$ACA_DATA/dashboard/synthesis.json` (created by session-insights skill, not via Claude API) |

### Session Discovery

Uses `lib/session_reader.py` module that reads:
- Claude session JSONL (`*.jsonl`)
- Agent transcripts (`agent-*.jsonl`)
- Hook logs (`*-hooks.jsonl`)

Same parser used by `/transcript` skill for markdown export.

### Dashboard Synthesis (No Claude API)

**CRITICAL**: Dashboard does NOT call Claude API. It loads pre-computed data from `$ACA_DATA/dashboard/synthesis.json`, created offline by session-insights skill via Gemini mining. This keeps dashboard fast and reduces API dependencies.

Dashboard sources for Session Insights Panel:
- synthesis.json structure (skill compliance, corrections, failures, successes)
- Top context gaps extracted from failure analysis
- Metrics aggregated per-session then rolled up to daily view

If synthesis.json is missing or stale: Dashboard will show a warning prompting you to run session-insights skill.
