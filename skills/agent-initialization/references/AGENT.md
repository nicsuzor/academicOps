# Agent Skills - Working Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Use Available Skills First

Before attempting any task, search for and use available skills in this workspace.

Skills provide specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools for specific domains or tasks. Each skill includes detailed instructions, working examples, and best practices.

**Always search for relevant skills before writing code or implementing solutions from scratch.**

## Available Skills Index

This workspace contains the following skills:

### Development & Code Quality

- **python-dev**: Use for all Python development tasks. Enforces fail-fast principles, type safety, Pydantic validation, and modern Python best practices. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Python code.

- **test-writing**: Use for all test creation and editing tasks. Enforces integration test patterns using real configurations and data, follows TDD methodology. Use whenever writing new tests or refactoring test suites.

- **git-commit**: Use when committing code changes to git repositories. Validates code quality against defined standards, enforces conventional commit format, and executes commits only when all validation passes.

- **no-throwaway-code**: Intervention skill that triggers when attempting temporary/throwaway Python code. Enforces writing for the long term and nudges toward reusable solutions.

### Project & Task Management

- **tasks**: Invoked SILENTLY and AUTOMATICALLY throughout conversations to capture tasks, priorities, and context. Manages the user's personal knowledge base, extracting information about tasks, projects, goals, and strategic priorities.

- **github-issue**: Manage GitHub issues across any repository with exhaustive search, precise documentation, and proactive updates. Use when documenting bugs, tracking features, updating issue status, or searching for related work.

### Framework & Skills

- **skill-creator**: Guide for creating effective skills. Use when creating new skills or updating existing skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.

- **skill-migration**: Use when extracting automation workflows from agent definitions or documentation files to create new, portable, reusable skills.

- **aops-bug**: Track bugs, agent violations, and framework improvements in the academicOps agent system. Use when agents violate axioms, framework bugs occur, experiments complete, or architecture needs updating. Specific to academicOps framework.

- **aops-trainer**: Use when reviewing and improving agents, skills, hooks, permissions, and configurations. Enforces an experiment-driven, anti-bloat approach. Use when agent performance issues arise or when maintaining the agent framework. Specific to academicOps framework.

### Domain-Specific

- **analyst**: Support academic research data analysis using dbt and Streamlit. Use when working with computational research projects (identified by dbt/ directory, Streamlit apps, or empirical data pipelines).

- **strategic-partner**: Provides strategic facilitation, questioning frameworks, and thinking partnership capabilities for planning and brainstorming sessions. Use when facilitating strategic discussions, exploring vision and constraints, or serving as a thinking partner.
