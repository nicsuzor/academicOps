Based on the file structure, you have a couple of good options. The most promising appears to be in `bot/docs/`.

I'd recommend checking `bot/docs/AUTO-EXTRACTION.md` or `bot/docs/DEEP-MINING-PATTERNS.md`.

To be sure, I can read the contents of these files for you.
Having reviewed the files, here's my recommendation:

*   `bot/docs/AUTO-EXTRACTION.md` is the correct place. It's an operational guide for the agent on what to extract and how, and it already contains a section called "COMMON PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE". This is the perfect spot for project-specific patterns.

*   `bot/docs/DEEP-MINING-PATTERNS.md` is more of a high-level, conceptual guide on how to *think* about information extraction and inference, rather than a list of specific, repeatable patterns.

I would recommend adding your new patterns to `bot/docs/AUTO-EXTRACTION.md`. I can do that for you if you'd like.
