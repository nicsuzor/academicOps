# aops v1.1 Release Acceptance Tests

This file defines acceptance tests for the aops v1.1 release. An LLM agent reads this file, executes each test, evaluates results, and updates the Results section.

## Instructions for Test Runner Agent

You are the test runner. For each test in the `## Tests` section:

1. **Read the test case** - understand the user input and expected behavior
2. **Execute the test** - use the specified invocation method:
   - `hydrator-only`: `Task(subagent_type="aops-core:prompt-hydrator", prompt="<user input>")`
   - `full-session`: Start a new Claude session with the user input
3. **Capture the output** - save the full response
4. **Evaluate pass criteria** - check if output satisfies all conditions
5. **Update the Results table** - mark PASS/FAIL with timestamp and notes
6. **Continue to next test**

When all tests complete, summarize: X passed, Y failed, Z errors.

## Tests

### TEST-001: Email Triage Routing

**ID**: `v1.1-email-triage-routing`

**Description**: When user requests email check, hydrator should use Outlook MCP tools to retrieve emails and present actionable options.

**User Input**:

```
check my email
```

**Expected Behavior**:

1. Hydrator identifies intent as email-related
2. Hydrator invokes Outlook MCP tools to retrieve email data
3. Output contains real email information (accounts, subjects, senders)
4. User presented with options to continue (search, read, triage)

**Invocation Method**: `hydrator-only`

**Pass Criteria** (QA agent evaluates semantically):

1. Hydrator output recommends using Outlook MCP tools for email retrieval
2. Hydrator output references email triage workflow (email-capture or similar)
3. Hydrator output includes steps for creating follow-up tasks from actionable emails

**Evaluation**: QA agent reads the hydrator output and judges whether it provides correct workflow guidance for email triage - NOT whether downstream tool execution succeeded.

**Why This Matters**: Validates hydrator recommends correct workflow. The hydrator provides context and workflow guidance - it does NOT execute tools. Test the hydrator's recommendations, not Outlook's execution.

**Related**:

- Workflow: `[[workflows/email-capture]]`
- Skill: `/email`
- MCP: `aops-tools/outlook`

### TEST-002: Framework Skill Routing for Internal Development

**ID**: `v1.1-framework-skill-routing`

**Description**: When user asks to debug a session, work on hooks, skills, or workflows, hydrator should recommend loading the framework skill for internal framework development work.

**User Input**:

```
I need to debug why the session hook isn't firing correctly
```

**Expected Behavior**:

1. Hydrator identifies intent as framework infrastructure work
2. Hydrator recognizes this involves hooks/skills/workflows (internal development)
3. Hydrator recommends loading the framework skill

**Invocation Method**: `hydrator-only`

**Pass Criteria** (QA agent evaluates semantically):

1. Hydrator output recommends loading or invoking the framework skill (or `/framework`)
2. Hydrator output identifies this as internal framework development or infrastructure work
3. Hydrator does NOT recommend unrelated skills like analyst, daily, or garden

**Evaluation**: QA agent reads the hydrator output and judges whether it correctly routes framework development requests to the framework skill - this tests the hydrator's workflow recommendation logic, not downstream skill execution.

**Why This Matters**: Users working on the aops framework itself (hooks, skills, workflows) need specialized context. The framework skill provides conventions, patterns, and routing rules for this internal development work. Incorrect routing wastes time and breaks development flow.

**Related**:

- Skill: `/framework`
- Workflows: `[[workflows/framework-development]]`
- Hydrator routing rules
