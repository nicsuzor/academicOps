# aops v1.1 Release Acceptance Tests

This file defines acceptance tests for the aops v1.1 release. An LLM agent reads this file, executes each test, evaluates results, and updates the Results section.

## Instructions for Test Runner Agent

You are the test runner. For each test in the `## Tests` section:

1. **Read the test case** - understand the user input and expected behavior
2. **Execute the test** - use the specified invocation method:
   - `hydrator-only`: `Task(subagent_type="aops-core:prompt-hydrator", prompt="<user input>")`
   - `full-session`: Start a new Claude session with the user input
3. **Capture the output** - save the full response
4. **Evaluate pass criteria** - check if output satisfies all conditions
5. **Update the Results table** - mark PASS/FAIL with timestamp and notes
6. **Continue to next test**

When all tests complete, summarize: X passed, Y failed, Z errors.

## Tests

### TEST-001: Email Triage Routing

**ID**: `v1.1-email-triage-routing`

**Description**: When user requests email check, hydrator should use Outlook MCP tools to retrieve emails and present actionable options.

**User Input**:
```
check my email
```

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Hydrator identifies intent as email-related
2. Hydrator invokes Outlook MCP tools to retrieve email data
3. Output contains real email information (accounts, subjects, senders)
4. User presented with options to continue (search, read, triage)

**Invocation Method**: `hydrator-only`

**Pass Criteria** (ALL must be true):
1. Output contains at least one of: "unread", "inbox", "messages", "email"
2. Output contains at least one of: "qut.edu.au", "suzor.net", "Recent messages", email subject text
3. Output contains at least one of: "Would you like", "search", "read", "specific"

**Why This Matters**: Validates hydrator routes natural language email requests to Outlook MCP. Success = real email data in output.
