### Agent (Turn 4)

I need to investigate this observation about `/diag` output incorrectly stating slash commands.

Let me first understand what the correct answer should be - checking for slash commands in the framework:

- Glob(pattern="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/commands/*.md")
- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/commands/diag.md")

I see the issue. The `/diag` command instructs to "List all commands from the SlashCommand tool's Available Commands section" - but there is no `SlashCommand` tool in my available tools. The command file references a tool that doesn't exist in my current toolset.

Let me log this:

- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/learning/LOG.md")

Now I understand the situation clearly. The `/diag` command references a `SlashCommand` tool that doesn't exist. Let me log this:

- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/learning/LOG.md")

Logged. The issue is a **component-level bug** in the `/diag` command itself - it references a `SlashCommand` tool that doesn't exist.

**Summary**: The agent's response ("None listed separately - skills ARE the slash commands") was actually a reasonable interpretation given there's no SlashCommand tool to query. The bug is in `commands/diag.md:20` which references nonexistent tooling.

**Fix needed**: Update `/diag` to either glob `$AOPS/commands/*.md` to list available slash commands, or acknowledge that commands are discovered via the Skill tool's skill list (since commands share the same namespace but different invocation method).

### Agent (Turn 5)

Logged. Two related issues captured:

1. **Component bug**: `/diag` references nonexistent `SlashCommand` tool
2. **Systemic issue**: learning-log skill lacks framework architecture knowledge (commands vs skills distinction)

The fix options for the systemic issue are documented. This is a recurring theme - skills operating in isolation without essential framework context.

- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/VISION.md")
- mcp__memory__retrieve_memory(query="user stories acceptance criteria success measures validat...")

Good question. Let me think through this carefully.

## The Core Tension

You're asking about **two different framings** for the same underlying problem:

1. **Technical framing**: "Agent should know how Claude Code works"
2. **User story framing**: "As a user, I want responses informed by infrastructure knowledge"

The answer is: **user stories are what matter, but they need to be the RIGHT user stories**.

## What Software Development Actually Does

The industry standard is:
- **User stories** define WHAT success looks like from user perspective
- **Acceptance criteria** define HOW we know it's achieved
- **Technical requirements** are derived FROM user stories, not vice versa

The problem with "agent should know how Claude Code works" is that it's a **means**, not an **end**. It's like saying "the database should be fast" - okay, but fast enough for what?

## The Right Framing for This Framework

Given that the framework's purpose is to **empower agents to manage it autonomously**, the user stories should be from YOUR perspective as the framework owner:

**Better user story**:
> As a framework owner, when I report a problem or request a change, I want the agent to have sufficient architectural knowledge to diagnose and fix it correctly the first time, so I don't have to correct basic misunderstandings about how components work.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Agent correctly identifies which component is involved (command vs skill vs hook)
- Agent knows where to look for relevant code/config
- Agent doesn't make false assumptions about how pieces connect
- Agent asks clarifying questions when genuinely uncertain, rather than guessing

## What's Missing Now

The current failure (learning-log not knowing commands ≠ skills) reveals:

1. **Skills are siloed** - Each skill knows its domain but not the framework architecture
2. **No shared architectural context** - The knowledge in `/meta` and `/framework` isn't available to other skills
3. **No validation** - Nothing checks whether an agent's mental model is correct before acting

## My Recommendation

**Don't create many more user stories.** That leads to bureaucratic overhead. Instead:

1. **One meta-user-story** that covers this class of problems:
   > "When working on framework issues, agents have accurate architectural knowledge"

2. **Shared architectural context** - A brief, authoritative reference that ANY skill can access (not duplicated in each skill)

3. **Validation mechanism** - Before a skill makes claims about framework architecture, it should verify against the source of truth

## Concrete Next Step

Should I draft:
- A shared architectural reference (commands vs skills vs hooks vs agents - what they are, where they live, how they relate)
- A user story for "framework-aware operations" with acceptance criteria

Which would be more useful right now?

### User (Turn 7 (at +15 minutes 19 seconds, took 1 minute 33 seconds))

i don't quite follow. ok, add this user story: `"When working on framework issues, agents have accurate architectural knowledge"`
Now what? where do we put acceptance criteria and technical requirements? don't fix the specific issue, help me fix the PROCESS of building the framework

### Agent (Turn 7)

You're right to push back. I gave you theory without showing the concrete process. Let me look at what structure we actually have.

- Glob(pattern="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/user-stories/*.md")
- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/skills/feature-dev/SKILL.md")
- Read(file_path="plan-quality-gate.md")
- Glob(pattern="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/skills/feature-dev/templates...")
- Read(file_path="user-story.md")

Now I see what exists. The process IS defined in `feature-dev` skill, but it's buried. Here's the actual structure:

## Current Process (Already Exists)

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **User Story** | `$ACA_DATA/projects/aops/user-stories/[name].md` | Requirements + acceptance criteria |
| **Experiment Plan** | `$ACA_DATA/projects/aops/experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-[name].md` | When implementing |
| **Tests** | `$AOPS/tests/` | Validation |
| **ROADMAP.md** | `$ACA_DATA/projects/aops/ROADMAP.md` | Status tracking |

The templates exist in `$AOPS/skills/feature-dev/templates/`.

Let me create the user story you asked for:

- Write(file_path="framework-aware-operations.md")

Now let me add it to ROADMAP tracking:

- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/ROADMAP.md")

Done. Here's the actual workflow:

## The Process (Now Visible)

```
1. CAPTURE → user-stories/[name].md
   (requirements + acceptance criteria in ONE file)

2. TRACK → ROADMAP.md User Stories table
   (status: Requirement → In Progress → Done)

3. IMPLEMENT → experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-[name].md
   (when you start building, create experiment)

4. TEST → tests/
   (write tests that validate acceptance criteria)

5. VALIDATE → check acceptance criteria boxes
   (in the user story file itself)
```

**Key insight**: The user story file IS the spec. Acceptance criteria live there. Technical requirements live there. Everything in one place per feature.

**What was missing**: You didn't know this structure existed. The process was buried in `feature-dev` skill. Now you have:
- 2 user stories in `user-stories/`
- ROADMAP tracks them
- Templates exist in `$AOPS/skills/feature-dev/templates/`

**Next time I encounter a problem like the learning-log issue**, I should:
1. Check if there's a user story that covers this
2. If not, create one (like I just did)
3. Track it in ROADMAP
4. When ready to fix, create experiment + tests

Does this structure make sense? The question now is: do you want me to implement the "Framework-Aware Operations" user story, or is capturing the requirement enough for now?

### User (Turn 8 (at +18 minutes 20 seconds, took 19 seconds))

ok, so now when we are working together, and i notice that you don't know where to put something, and i think 'i should report this violation of the `framework aware operations` requirement', what should i do that will help you address this over the long term?

- Hook(UserPromptSubmit) ✓
  - Skills matched: `framework`
  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

### Agent (Turn 8)

Use `/log` with a reference to the user story:

```
/log framework-aware-operations: agent didn't know commands live in $AOPS/commands/
```

That creates a LOG.md entry tagged to the user story. When I implement the fix, I can grep LOG.md for `framework-aware-operations` to find all the evidence of what's broken.

**The feedback loop**:
```
You observe violation → /log [user-story-name]: [what happened]
                              ↓
                        LOG.md entry with reference
                              ↓
                        When implementing, grep for user-story-name
                              ↓
                        Evidence informs solution
```

**What this gives you**:
- Quick capture (just `/log` with story name prefix)
- Observations accumulate as evidence
- Implementation is informed by real failures, not guesses

**What I should do when I see `/log framework-aware-operations:`**:
1. Log the observation
2. Recognize this is evidence against a tracked user story
3. Note it as a data point for eventual implementation

Want me to update the learning-log skill to recognize user story references and link them explicitly?

### User (Turn 9 (at +20 minutes, took 13 seconds))

ok, but i forget all the user stories. so how would you update the /log command to help make this easier?

- Hook(UserPromptSubmit) ✓
  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

### Agent (Turn 9)

Simple fix: when `/log` runs, it should:

1. Read `$ACA_DATA/projects/aops/user-stories/*.md` 
2. Semantically match the observation to relevant stories
3. Auto-tag the LOG entry with the related story
4. Tell you which story it linked to

**You say**: `/log agent didn't know where commands live`

**Skill does**: Matches to "framework-aware-operations", tags entry, reports "Linked to: framework-aware-operations"

No memorization required. The skill does the matching.

Want me to update the learning-log skill with this?

### User (Turn 10 (at +22 minutes 26 seconds, took 36 seconds))

you want to read ALL user stories for EVERY log? that doesnt seem efficient (btw: please add an axiom: framework instructions should be no more detailed than is required.)

  - Skills matched: `framework`
  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

### Agent (Turn 10)

You're right. Let me add that axiom first:

- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/AXIOMS.md")
- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/AXIOMS.md")

Axiom added.

Simpler `/log` approach:

**Option A**: User adds prefix when they want to link
```
/log → framework-aware-operations: agent didn't know X
```
Skill parses `→ story-name:` prefix, no file reads needed.

**Option B**: Skill globs filenames only (cheap), shows list at end
```
Related stories: framework-aware-operations, plan-quality-gate
Add "→ [name]:" prefix to link.
```

Option A is minimal. Option B is slightly helpful but still cheap (just `ls`, not read).

Which do you prefer?

### User (Turn 11 (at +23 minutes 45 seconds, took 18 seconds))

dont we have an index file? or what is it called in notetaking, a MoC?

- Hook(UserPromptSubmit) ✓
  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

- Glob(pattern="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/**/INDEX*.md")
- Glob(pattern="/opt/nic/writing/data/projects/aops/**/MOC*.md")

### Agent (Turn 11)

No MoC, but ROADMAP.md already has the user stories table:

```markdown
## User Stories (Requirements)

| Story | Status | Spec |
|-------|--------|------|
| Plan Quality Gate - ... | Requirement | `user-stories/plan-quality-gate.md` |
| Framework-Aware Operations - ... | Requirement | `user-stories/framework-aware-operations.md` |
```

ROADMAP.md IS the index. Skill reads one file, parses the table, gets story names. Done.

### User (Turn 12 (at +25 minutes 25 seconds, took 38 seconds))

ok. so shouldn't the log skill do that?

- Hook(UserPromptSubmit) ✓
  - Skills matched: `framework`
  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

### Agent (Turn 12)

Yes. Let me update it:

- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/skills/learning-log/SKILL.md")
- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/skills/learning-log/SKILL.md")
- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/skills/learning-log/SKILL.md")

Done. Now `/log` will:
1. Read ROADMAP.md (one file)
2. Parse user story names from table
3. Link observation if relevant
4. Include `**User Story**: [name]` in LOG entry

### User (Turn 13 (at +29 minutes 2 seconds, took 49 seconds))

ok, can you reflect on this whole conversatoin. you're the meta framework agent. can you see how your approach to framework development was different to mine? how would you update your instructions for future meta fraework agents?

  - Skills matched: `framework`
  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

### Agent (Turn 13)

Yes. Looking back:

**My approach**:
- Jumped to theory ("user stories vs technical requirements")
- Proposed over-engineered solutions (read ALL user stories, semantic matching)
- Didn't check what already existed
- Needed multiple prompts to find simpler answers

**Your approach**:
- "Where do we put things?" - concrete, not abstract
- "Don't we have an index file?" - pointed to existing patterns
- "That doesn't seem efficient" - enforced minimalism
- Built on ROADMAP.md instead of creating new infrastructure

**What I missed**:
1. ROADMAP.md already had the user stories table
2. The process already existed in feature-dev skill
3. The answer was almost always "use what's there"

**Updates for /meta instructions**:

- Read(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/commands/meta.md")
- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/commands/meta.md")

Done. The lesson is now encoded:

**"EXTEND, DON'T INVENT"** - check what exists, follow established patterns, extend rather than create, listen when user pushes back.

This was the gap: I kept proposing new things when the infrastructure was already there.

### User (Turn 14 (at +30 minutes 41 seconds, took 16 seconds))

ok, but you jump straight to glob/grep. DO WE have indices? README.md? roadmap.md? index.md? shouldn't they be the first thing to check?

You're right. Fix:

Done. Indices first, glob/grep last.

### User (Turn 15 (at +32 minutes 6 seconds, took 24 seconds))

now shouldn't you do this other times as well as before proposing infrastructure? it seems likeit might be relevant to know when you're trying to understand behaviour...

### Agent (Turn 15)

Yes. It's a general principle - check maps before exploring:

- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/commands/meta.md")

Done. Split into two principles:
- **INDICES FIRST** - general (understanding, proposing, debugging)
- **EXTEND, DON'T INVENT** - when adding

### User (Turn 16 (at +32 minutes 52 seconds, took 22 seconds))

ok, now what about the /log command. should it also do this sort of background reading?

  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.
You are operating in a sensitive academic environment that requires...

### Agent (Turn 16)

Good question. The original problem: /log claimed "skills ARE slash commands" because it didn't know better.

Two options:

**A. Add reading**: /log reads ROADMAP.md (already does for user stories) + quick architecture reference
**B. Add humility**: /log notes uncertainty about framework architecture rather than guessing

Option B is more minimal - don't read more, just don't make claims you can't support.

But actually - ROADMAP.md already lists what exists (skills, commands, hooks as separate sections). If /log reads it for user stories, it should already see the architecture.

The fix might just be: when logging framework observations, **use what you read in Phase 0** (ROADMAP) to understand component types. Don't guess.

Want me to add that clarification to the skill, or is the current Phase 0 sufficient?

### User (Turn 17 (at +36 minutes 26 seconds, took 18 seconds))

the problem is that neither of us know the answer to that. so think of this as a process: we know what we want (informed framework skill); we know it failed; we DON'T know what will work to fix it. You need to come up with a meta process to deal with this pattern.

  - **CRITICAL**: Focus on the user's specific request. Do NOT over-elaborate or add unrequested features. Complete the task, then stop.

### Agent (Turn 17)

You're right. We have:
- Requirement: framework-aware operations
- Evidence of failure: /log made wrong claims
- No proven fix

This is an **experiment**, not a known solution.

**Meta process**:

1. **User story exists** - requirement captured ✓
2. **Failure logged** - evidence captured ✓
3. **Hypothesis**: "Reading ROADMAP.md in Phase 0 provides enough architectural context"
4. **Minimal change made** - Phase 0 added ✓
5. **Wait for next failure** - if it fails again, `/log → framework-aware-operations: [what happened]`
6. **Evidence accumulates** against user story
7. **Revise hypothesis** when pattern is clear

The user story becomes the anchor. Each failure linked to it is evidence. When we have enough evidence, we'll know what actually works.

Should I create the experiment file to track this hypothesis?

yes

### Agent (Turn 18)

Done. Feedback loop is set:

```
User story ← LOG entry → Experiment
                ↓
        Next failure: /log → framework-aware-operations: [what happened]
                ↓
        Evidence accumulates in experiment
                ↓
        Revise hypothesis when pattern clear
```

### User (Turn 19 (at +41 minutes, took 33 seconds))

ok, review this conversatoin one more time. is there anything else we should add to instructions for future agents when dealing with meta framework issues?

### Agent (Turn 19)

Key lesson I don't see captured yet: **when the fix is uncertain, create an experiment instead of guessing**.

I kept proposing solutions. You kept saying "we don't know what will work." The answer was: set up the feedback loop and wait for evidence.

- Edit(file_path="/opt/nic/writing/academicOps/commands/meta.md")

That captures the main lessons from this conversation:

1. **INDICES FIRST** - check maps before exploring
2. **EXTEND, DON'T INVENT** - build on what exists  
3. **WHEN UNCERTAIN, EXPERIMENT** - don't guess, set up feedback loop

Plus AXIOM #26 (minimal instructions) and the /log update for user story linking.

### User (Turn 20 (at +42 minutes 10 seconds, took 26 seconds))

yes - the feedback loop is really important! that's what has been missing from the meta framework agent's sill set. should we make thatan axiom?

Yes. It's fundamental - it's the meta-process for improving the framework when we don't know what will work.
