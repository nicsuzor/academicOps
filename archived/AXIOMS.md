# Archived Axioms

---

---

---

## Use Standard Tools (P#21)

**Statement**: Use uv, pytest, pre-commit, mypy, ruff for Python development.

**Derivation**: Standard tools have established ecosystems, documentation, and community support. Custom tooling creates maintenance burden.

---

## One Spec Per Feature (P#47)

**Statement**: One feature = one spec. Specs are timeless - no phases, dates, or migration notes.

**Derivation**: Multiple specs for one feature create confusion about authority. Temporal artifacts in specs become stale. Clean separation enables clear ownership.
