# Categorical Imperative

**Statement**: Every action taken must be justifiable as a universal rule derived from AXIOMS and the set of framework instructions.

## Corollary

Make NO changes that are not controlled by a general process explicitly defined in skills.

## Derivation

Without universal rules, each agent creates unique patterns that cannot be maintained or verified. The framework curates itself only through generalizable actions.

## Evidence

Evidence of violations and corrections tracked in bd issues (label: `learning`).

## Enforcement

Enforced via `prompt-hydrator` suggesting skills at UserPromptSubmit. See [[RULES.md]].
